#### [Influence of radiative pumping on the HD rotational level populations in diffuse molecular clouds of the interstellar medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09342)
- # HD excitation
- Question: 
	- H2 is hardly observed due to the lack of dipole moment. HD is thus a possible way to trace H2. However, the conditions traced by HD are poorly constrained in diffuse molecular clouds.
- Aims: 
	- To study the excitation of HD rotational level populations in diffuse molecular clouds.
- new method: 
	- Theoretical calculations.
- progress: 
	- They find that HD is mainly determined by radiative pumping rather than collision in diffuse molecular clouds, and thus become a more sensitive indicator of the UV radiation intensity. 
- note:
	- Can HD become a good tracer for the total mass in such an environment?
