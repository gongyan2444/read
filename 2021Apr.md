#### [The G 305 Star-forming Region: II. Irregular variable stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02200)
- # G305
- Question: 
	- This variable brightness also can be observed in several stages of the classical model of pre-MS evolution, after the collapse of a molecular cloud has begun. Due to conservation of angular momentum, the infalling matter forms a protostellar disk, through which accretion on to the central source occurs (McKee & Ostriker 2007; Li et al. 2014). Numerous physical processes are involved in the evolution from a heavily obscured protostar until it reaches the main sequence. The physical origin of the variability could be a consequence of irregular intrinsic changes, such as episodic accretion (Audard et al. 2014), variable extinction induced by their circumstellar disks (e.g., Meyer et al. 1997; Cody et al. 2014; Rebull et al. 2014a), rotational modulation by cool and hot spots on the stellar surface, and the variations in accretion disk/envelope geometry.
- Aims: 
	- We aim to unveil and characterize the young stellar object (YSO) population of the region by analyzing the Ks-band variability and JHKs infrared colors.
- method: 
	-  the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) survey. Additionally, SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 infrared spectra.
- progress: 
	- We present a catalog of 167 newly discovered, irregular variables spanning a ∼7 deg2 area that encompasses the G 305 star-forming complex, one of the most luminous giant H II regions in the Galaxy.

#### [Fragmentation and kinematics in high-mass star formation: CORE-extension targeting two very young high-mass star-forming regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02420)
- # CORE # ISOSS22478 # ISOSS23053
- Question:
	- Important questions regarding the earliest evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation are related to the fragmentation properties of the dense gas and the associated kinematic properties. For example, we consider whether these very young regions fragment early on into many lower-mass cores that may then competitively accrete gas from the surrounding envelope (e.g., Bonnell et al. 2007; Smith et al. 2009). Alternatively, they may fragment into more massive cores with potentially less lowmass cores early on (e.g., Tan et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2015; Csengeri et al. 2017; Beuther et al. 2018)? We ask how important filamentary accretion processes are (e.g., Schneider et al. 2010; Peretto et al. 2014; André et al. 2014; Chira et al. 2018; Hennebelle 2018; Padoan et al. 2020) and what the relative importance is of cloud-scale gravo-turbulent or thermal fragmentation versus fragmentation of the gravitationally unstable accretion flows for the star formation process (e.g., Peters et al. 2010)? Furthermore, it has been argued that high-mass star formation starts and proceeds in turbulent gas clumps (e.g., McKee & Tan 2003).
- Aims:
	- We aim to study the dynamical and fragmentation properties at very early evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation.

- Method:
	- NOEMA obervations.
- progress:
	- 29 cores. a mass-size relation of approximately M ∝ r^2.0±0.3, constant surface density. The correlation of the core masses with their nearest neighbor separations is consistent with thermal Jeans fragmentation. The findings can all be explained within the framework of a dynamical cloud collapse scenario. (The magnetization of the gas or external shocks triggering converging gas flows?)

#### [Warm ISM in the Sgr A Complex. II. The [C/N] abundance ratio traced by [CII] 158 um and [NII] 205 um observations toward the Arched Filaments at the Galactic center](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02489)
- # Sgr A # C/N ratio
- Question:
	- The Arches Cluster - Arched Filaments (AF) system is our Galaxy’s prime example of the complexity involved in the interaction between the strong radiation field of numerous OB stars and their surrounding ISM in extremely harsh environments such as the Galactic center (GC) of the Milky Way. It offers a unique opportunity to study the close relationship between photon-dominated regions (PDRs) and H II regions and their relative contributions to the observed [CII] emission.
- Aims:
	- We aim to investigate the I([CII]) versus I([NII]) integrated intensity behavior in the AF region in order to assess the [CII] emission contribution from the H II region, which is traced by [NII] line observations, and PDR components in the high-metallicity environment of the GC.
- Methods:
	- We used [CII] 158 µm and [NII] 205 µm fine structure line observations of the AF in the literature to compare their observational integrated intensity distribution to semi-theoretical predictions for the contribution of H II regions and adjacent PDRs to the observed [CII] emission. We explored variations in the [C/N] elemental abundance ratio to explain the overall behavior of the observed relationship. Based on our models, the H II region and PDR contributions to the observed [CII] emission is calculated for a few positions within and near to the AF. Estimates for the [C/N] abundance ratio and [N/H] nitrogen elemental abundance in the AF can then be derived.
- Progress:
	- Our results yield average values for the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and nitrogen elemental abundances of [C/N]AF = 1.13 ± 0.09 and [N/H]AF = 6.21×10−4 for the AF, respectively. They are a factor of ∼ 0.4 smaller and ∼ 7.5 larger than their corresponding Galactic disk values. We suggest that secondary production of nitrogen from low- to intermediate-mass stars in the Galactic bulge is a plausible mechanism to explain the large abundance differences between the GC and the Galactic disk.

#### [The ALMA Survey of 70μm Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) III. A Young Molecular Outflow Driven by a Decelerating Jet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02625)
- # 70 micro dark # jet
- Question:
	- the study of the physical processes behind the launching and collimation of jets in star formation is important in itself since it can contribute to better understand the jet phenomenon in other astrophysical contexts.
- Aims:
	- carry out observations of molecular outflows to characterize their physical conditions and constrain the values of the input parameters of the models.
- Methods:
	- ALMA CO (2-1) observations. 
- progress:
	- Detection of CO outflows from the 70 μm dark clump G010.991−00.082. The P-V diagram has a peculiar S-shaped morphology that is explained by means of two components with different kinematical characteristics: an inner axial high-velocity component that moves with high velocity but decelerates, and a co-axial component moving with lower velocity but whose velocity increases with distance from the central source. The spatio-kinematical model is interpreted as a jet-driven molecular outflow.

#### [Seed of Life in Space (SOLIS) XI. First measurement of nitrogen fractionation in shocked clumps of the L1157 protostellar outflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14882)
- # L1157 # N isotopic ratio
- Question:
	- The isotopic ratio of nitrogen presents a wide range of values in the Solar System and in star forming system whose origin is still unclear. Chemical reactions in the gas phase are one of the possible processes that could modify the 14N/15N ratio.
- Aims:
	- investigating if and how the passage of a shock wave in the interstellar medium, can affect the relative fraction of nitrogen isotopes.
- Methods:
	- HCN measurements toward L1157.
- progress:
	- In this region the ratio H13CN(1-0)/HC15N(1-0) is quite uniform with an average value of ∼ 5±1. We found that the nitrogen and carbon fractionations do not vary much for the first period after the shock. Both observations and chemical models indicate that the shock propagation does not affect the nitrogen isotopic ratio that remains similar to that measured in lower temperature gas in prestellar cores and in protostellar envelopes.

#### [The Circumnuclear Disk Revealed by ALMA. I. Dense Clouds and Tides in the Galactic Center](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02078)
- # GC # CS
- Question:
	- The interplay between black hole feeding and star formation is therefore of paramount importance in the life-cycle of galaxies.
- Aims:
	- Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*.
- Method:
	- Utilizing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we present CS line maps in five rotational lines (Ju=7,5,4,3,2) toward the circumnuclear disk (CND) and streamers of the Galactic Center.
- Progress:
	- The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05−0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σFWHM=5−40 km s−1). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (Tk≥50−500 K, nH2=103−5 cm−3) and cold gas (Tk≤50 K, nH2=106−8 cm−3). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that 84+16−37 % of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10−100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore, inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1.5 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥108 cm−3.

#### [Magnetic Properties of Star-Forming Dense Cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02597)
- # B field # star formation  
- Question:
	- Two pictures (weak B and strong B) are proposed to explain star formation processes. A more complete picture depends on accurate estimates of field strength, and on corroboration by independent methods. 
- Aims:
	- The goals are to determine whether DCF and Zeeman magnetic properties are consistent, to understand the distribution of M/MB, and to understand the B - N and B − n correlations noted above. 
- Method:
	- DCF+zeeman.
- Progress:
	- The 17 cores are on average mildly supercritical. The plane-of-sky field strengths are almost linearly correlated with column density.

#### [HCN (1-0) opacity of outflowing gas in Arp 220W](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02896)
- # HCN # outflows in galaxies
- Question:
	- Outflow mass is important to understand the feedback of AGN and starbursts. The conversion from line luminosities to masses depends on the optical depth that is poorly constrained.
- Aims:
	- Determin the optical depth of outflowing gas with isotopic ratios in Arp 220W.
- Methods:
	- Using H13CN 1-0, the isotopic line of HCN 1-0, to obtain the line ratio of HCN/H13CN 1-0 is an ideal way to derive the optical depth of HCN 1-0 in outflowing gas.
- results:
	- The high HCN/H13CN 1-0 line ratio indicates low opacity of HCN 1-0 in the outflowing gas, even though the upper limit of HCN 1-0 opacity obtained here is still not good enough to draw any robust conclusions if HCN 1-0 is optically thin. A lower conversion factor of HCN 1-0 luminosity to dense gas mass in the outflowing gas should be used than that used for the host galaxy of Arp 220.

#### [Complex organic molecules in low-mass protostars on Solar System scales -- II. Nitrogen-bearing species](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03326)
- Questions:
	- Much less is known about the formation of N-bearing species in ices. Nitrogen-bearing molecules are important as nitrogen is a crucial element in developing biomolecules such as amino acids and nucleobases, and they are thus essential for the emergence of life. N-bearing COMs have been detected in high-mass (e.g. Isokoski et al. 2013; Belloche et al. 2016; Bøgelund et al. 2019b; Csengeri et al. 2019; Ligterink et al. 2020) and lowmass protostars (e.g. Bottinelli et al. 2008; Ligterink et al. 2018; Marcelino et al. 2018; Calcutt et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2019; Belloche et al. 2020). In order to elucidate the formation pathways to N-bearing COMs, more observational constraints on their abundances are needed. D/H values provide clues on the temperature at which N-bearing COMs are formed, and thus on their formation history (Taquet et al. 2012, 2014; Furuya et al. 2016). To assess whether many of the N- and O-bearing COMs are indeed produced in ices, a smoking gun would be to detect their ice features directly at mid-infrared wavelengths. (ice species JWST). One of the most well-studied low-mass protostars in complex chemistry is IRAS 16293-2422 (hereafter IRAS 16293), which
was investigated as part of the ALMA Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) programme (Jørgensen et al. 2016). The PILS gives the most complete inventory of nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing COMs in low-mass protostars to date (Coutens
et al. 2016; Ligterink et al. 2017; Ligterink et al. 2018; Calcutt et al. 2018; Manigand et al. 2020). Jørgensen et al. (2018) and Manigand et al. (2020) suggest that there are two categories for O-bearing and N-bearing species: Some molecules desorb at temperatures of ∼100 K and others at ∼300 K, closer to the central protostar. Apart from IRAS 16293, N-bearing COMs have been observed with ALMA towards a handful of lowmass sources: HH 212 (Lee et al. 2019), NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2
(López-Sepulcre et al. 2017), B1b-S (Marcelino et al. 2018), B335 (Imai et al. 2016), and L483 (Oya et al. 2017). This list has also been supplemented using the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) and its upgraded version, the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA; Taquet et al. 2015; Belloche et al.
2020). (N- O- dichotomy).
- Aims:
	- The aim is to investigate N-bearing complex organic molecules towards two Class 0 protostars (B1-c and S68N) at millimetre wavelengths with ALMA.
- Method:
	- ALMA observations.
- Result:
	- NH2CHO, C2H5CN, HNCO, HN13CO, DNCO, CH3CN, CH2DCN, and CHD2CN are identified towards the investigated sources. Their abundances relative to CH3OH and HNCO are similar for the two sources, with column densities that are typically an order of magnitude lower than those of O-bearing species. The largest variations, of an order of magnitude, are seen for NH2CHO abundance ratios with respect to HNCO and CH3OH and do not correlate with the protostellar luminosity. In addition, within uncertainties, the N-bearing species have similar excitation temperatures to those of O-bearing species (∼ 100 ∼ 300 K). The similarity of most abundances with respect to HNCO, including those of CH2DCN and CHD2CN, hints at a shared chemical history, especially the high D/H ratio in cold regions prior to star formation. However, some of the variations in abundances may reflect the sensitivity of the chemistry to local conditions such as temperature (e.g. NH2CHO), while others may arise from differences in the emitting areas of the molecules linked to their different binding energies in the ice. The two sources discussed here add to the small number of sources with such a detailed chemical analysis on Solar System scales. Future JWST data will allow a direct comparison between the ice and gas abundances of N-bearing species.


#### [Anisotropic Turbulence in Position-Position-Velocity Space: Probing Three-Dimensional Magnetic Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02842)
- # B field # turbulence
- Question:
	- Direct measurements of three-dimensional magnetic fields in the interstellar medium (ISM) are not achievable. However, the anisotropic nature of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence provides a novel way of tracing the magnetic fields.
- Aims:
	- determine 3D B field.
- Method:
	- Guided by the advanced understanding of turbulence's anisotropy in the Position-Position-Velocity (PPV) space, we extend the Structure-Function Analysis (SFA) to measure both the three-dimensional magnetic field orientation and Alfven Mach number MA, which provides the information on magnetic field strength.
- progress:
	- Following the theoretical framework developed in Kandel et al. (2016), we find that the anisotropy in a given velocity channel is affected by the inclination angle between the 3D magnetic field direction and the line-of-sight as well as media magnetization. We analyze the synthetic PPV cubes generated by incompressible and compressible MHD simulations. We confirm that the PPV channel's intensity fluctuations measured in various position angles reveal plane-of-the-sky magnetic field orientation. We show that by varying the channel width, the anisotropies of the intensity fluctuations in PPV space can be used to simultaneously estimate both magnetic field inclination angle and strength of total magnetic fields.

#### [Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-Forming Regions (MagMaR) I. Linear Polarized Imaging of the UCHII Region G5.89-0.39](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03331)
- # B field # G5.89-0.39
- Question:
	- The role played by the magnetic fields in each of the processes mentioned above is still not well understood because of the difficulty in their detection and measurement.
- Aims:
	- study the B-field relation with the star formation processes.
- Method:
	- ALMA continuum observations. 
- progress:
	- Its millimeter emission shows a dusty belt with a mass of 55-115 M and 4,500 au in radius, surrounding an inner part comprising mostly ionized gas with a dust emission only accounting about 30% of the total millimeter emission.The polarization fraction is ∼ 4.4% in the filaments and 2.1% at the shell. The magnetic fields are along the North Filament and perpendicular to the South Filament. In the Central Shell, the magnetic fields are roughly radial in a ring surrounding the dusty belt between 4,500 and 7,500 au, similar to the pattern recently found in the surroundings of Orion BN/KL. This may be an independent observational signpost of explosive dispersal outflows and should be further investigated in other regions. (explosive outflows reported toward this source).

#### [Probing the structure of a massive filament: ArTeMiS 350 and 450 micron mapping of the integral-shaped filament in Orion A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03717)
- # filament # Orion A
- Question:
	- It is an ideal target to investigate the detailed structure of massive star-forming filaments at high resolution and the relevance of the filament paradigm for the earliest stages of intermediate- to high-mass star formation.
- Aims:
	- Our aim is to characterize the structure of this massive filament at moderately high angular resolution (800 or ∼ 0.016 pc), in order to measure the intrinsic width of the main filament, down to scales well below 0.1 pc, identified as the characteristic width of filaments.
- Method:
	- We used the ArTéMiS bolometer camera at APEX to map a ∼0.6×0.2 deg2
region covering OMC-1, OMC-2, OMC-3 at 350 and 450 µm.
- Progress:
	- We measure intrinsic half-power widths in the range 0.06 to 0.11 pc. This is significantly larger than the Gaussian widths measured for fibers seen in N2H+, which probably traces only the dense innermost regions of the large-scale filament. These half-power widths are within a factor of two of the value of ∼ 0.1 pc found for a large sample of nearby filaments in various low-mass star-forming regions, which tends to indicate that the physical conditions governing the fragmentation of prestellar cores within transcritical or supercritical filaments are the same over a large range of masses per unit length.
