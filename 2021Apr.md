#### [The G 305 Star-forming Region: II. Irregular variable stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02200)
- # G305
- Question: 
	- This variable brightness also can be observed in several stages of the classical model of pre-MS evolution, after the collapse of a molecular cloud has begun. Due to conservation of angular momentum, the infalling matter forms a protostellar disk, through which accretion on to the central source occurs (McKee & Ostriker 2007; Li et al. 2014). Numerous physical processes are involved in the evolution from a heavily obscured protostar until it reaches the main sequence. The physical origin of the variability could be a consequence of irregular intrinsic changes, such as episodic accretion (Audard et al. 2014), variable extinction induced by their circumstellar disks (e.g., Meyer et al. 1997; Cody et al. 2014; Rebull et al. 2014a), rotational modulation by cool and hot spots on the stellar surface, and the variations in accretion disk/envelope geometry.
- Aims: 
	- We aim to unveil and characterize the young stellar object (YSO) population of the region by analyzing the Ks-band variability and JHKs infrared colors.
- method: 
	-  the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) survey. Additionally, SDSS-IV APOGEE-2 infrared spectra.
- progress: 
	- We present a catalog of 167 newly discovered, irregular variables spanning a ∼7 deg2 area that encompasses the G 305 star-forming complex, one of the most luminous giant H II regions in the Galaxy.

#### [Fragmentation and kinematics in high-mass star formation: CORE-extension targeting two very young high-mass star-forming regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02420)
- # CORE # ISOSS22478 # ISOSS23053
- Question:
	- Important questions regarding the earliest evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation are related to the fragmentation properties of the dense gas and the associated kinematic properties. For example, we consider whether these very young regions fragment early on into many lower-mass cores that may then competitively accrete gas from the surrounding envelope (e.g., Bonnell et al. 2007; Smith et al. 2009). Alternatively, they may fragment into more massive cores with potentially less lowmass cores early on (e.g., Tan et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2015; Csengeri et al. 2017; Beuther et al. 2018)? We ask how important filamentary accretion processes are (e.g., Schneider et al. 2010; Peretto et al. 2014; André et al. 2014; Chira et al. 2018; Hennebelle 2018; Padoan et al. 2020) and what the relative importance is of cloud-scale gravo-turbulent or thermal fragmentation versus fragmentation of the gravitationally unstable accretion flows for the star formation process (e.g., Peters et al. 2010)? Furthermore, it has been argued that high-mass star formation starts and proceeds in turbulent gas clumps (e.g., McKee & Tan 2003).
- Aims:
	- We aim to study the dynamical and fragmentation properties at very early evolutionary stages of high-mass star formation.

- Method:
	- NOEMA obervations.
- progress:
	- 29 cores. a mass-size relation of approximately M ∝ r^2.0±0.3, constant surface density. The correlation of the core masses with their nearest neighbor separations is consistent with thermal Jeans fragmentation. The findings can all be explained within the framework of a dynamical cloud collapse scenario. (The magnetization of the gas or external shocks triggering converging gas flows?)

#### [Warm ISM in the Sgr A Complex. II. The [C/N] abundance ratio traced by [CII] 158 um and [NII] 205 um observations toward the Arched Filaments at the Galactic center](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02489)
- # Sgr A # C/N ratio
- Question:
	- The Arches Cluster - Arched Filaments (AF) system is our Galaxy’s prime example of the complexity involved in the interaction between the strong radiation field of numerous OB stars and their surrounding ISM in extremely harsh environments such as the Galactic center (GC) of the Milky Way. It offers a unique opportunity to study the close relationship between photon-dominated regions (PDRs) and H II regions and their relative contributions to the observed [CII] emission.
- Aims:
	- We aim to investigate the I([CII]) versus I([NII]) integrated intensity behavior in the AF region in order to assess the [CII] emission contribution from the H II region, which is traced by [NII] line observations, and PDR components in the high-metallicity environment of the GC.
- Methods:
	- We used [CII] 158 µm and [NII] 205 µm fine structure line observations of the AF in the literature to compare their observational integrated intensity distribution to semi-theoretical predictions for the contribution of H II regions and adjacent PDRs to the observed [CII] emission. We explored variations in the [C/N] elemental abundance ratio to explain the overall behavior of the observed relationship. Based on our models, the H II region and PDR contributions to the observed [CII] emission is calculated for a few positions within and near to the AF. Estimates for the [C/N] abundance ratio and [N/H] nitrogen elemental abundance in the AF can then be derived.
- Progress:
	- Our results yield average values for the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and nitrogen elemental abundances of [C/N]AF = 1.13 ± 0.09 and [N/H]AF = 6.21×10−4 for the AF, respectively. They are a factor of ∼ 0.4 smaller and ∼ 7.5 larger than their corresponding Galactic disk values. We suggest that secondary production of nitrogen from low- to intermediate-mass stars in the Galactic bulge is a plausible mechanism to explain the large abundance differences between the GC and the Galactic disk.

#### [The ALMA Survey of 70μm Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) III. A Young Molecular Outflow Driven by a Decelerating Jet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02625)
- # 70 micro dark # jet
- Question:
	- the study of the physical processes behind the launching and collimation of jets in star formation is important in itself since it can contribute to better understand the jet phenomenon in other astrophysical contexts.
- Aims:
	- carry out observations of molecular outflows to characterize their physical conditions and constrain the values of the input parameters of the models.
- Methods:
	- ALMA CO (2-1) observations. 
- progress:
	- Detection of CO outflows from the 70 μm dark clump G010.991−00.082. The P-V diagram has a peculiar S-shaped morphology that is explained by means of two components with different kinematical characteristics: an inner axial high-velocity component that moves with high velocity but decelerates, and a co-axial component moving with lower velocity but whose velocity increases with distance from the central source. The spatio-kinematical model is interpreted as a jet-driven molecular outflow.

#### [Seed of Life in Space (SOLIS) XI. First measurement of nitrogen fractionation in shocked clumps of the L1157 protostellar outflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14882)
- # L1157 # N isotopic ratio
- Question:
	- The isotopic ratio of nitrogen presents a wide range of values in the Solar System and in star forming system whose origin is still unclear. Chemical reactions in the gas phase are one of the possible processes that could modify the 14N/15N ratio.
- Aims:
	- investigating if and how the passage of a shock wave in the interstellar medium, can affect the relative fraction of nitrogen isotopes.
- Methods:
	- HCN measurements toward L1157.
- progress:
	- In this region the ratio H13CN(1-0)/HC15N(1-0) is quite uniform with an average value of ∼ 5±1. We found that the nitrogen and carbon fractionations do not vary much for the first period after the shock. Both observations and chemical models indicate that the shock propagation does not affect the nitrogen isotopic ratio that remains similar to that measured in lower temperature gas in prestellar cores and in protostellar envelopes.

#### [The Circumnuclear Disk Revealed by ALMA. I. Dense Clouds and Tides in the Galactic Center](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02078)
- # GC # CS
- Question:
	- The interplay between black hole feeding and star formation is therefore of paramount importance in the life-cycle of galaxies.
- Aims:
	- Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*.
- Method:
	- Utilizing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we present CS line maps in five rotational lines (Ju=7,5,4,3,2) toward the circumnuclear disk (CND) and streamers of the Galactic Center.
- Progress:
	- The CS clouds have sizes of 0.05−0.2 pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion (σFWHM=5−40 km s−1). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm (Tk≥50−500 K, nH2=103−5 cm−3) and cold gas (Tk≤50 K, nH2=106−8 cm−3). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that 84+16−37 % of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities 10−100 times higher than the tidal limit at distance ≥1.5 pc to Sgr A*, and therefore, inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central 1.5 pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to ≥108 cm−3.

#### [Magnetic Properties of Star-Forming Dense Cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02597)
- # B field # star formation  
- Question:
	- Two pictures (weak B and strong B) are proposed to explain star formation processes. A more complete picture depends on accurate estimates of field strength, and on corroboration by independent methods. 
- Aims:
	- The goals are to determine whether DCF and Zeeman magnetic properties are consistent, to understand the distribution of M/MB, and to understand the B - N and B − n correlations noted above. 
- Method:
	- DCF+zeeman.
- Progress:
	- The 17 cores are on average mildly supercritical. The plane-of-sky field strengths are almost linearly correlated with column density.

### April 7
#### [HCN (1-0) opacity of outflowing gas in Arp 220W](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02896)
- # HCN # outflows in galaxies
- Question:
	- Outflow mass is important to understand the feedback of AGN and starbursts. The conversion from line luminosities to masses depends on the optical depth that is poorly constrained.
- Aims:
	- Determin the optical depth of outflowing gas with isotopic ratios in Arp 220W.
- Methods:
	- Using H13CN 1-0, the isotopic line of HCN 1-0, to obtain the line ratio of HCN/H13CN 1-0 is an ideal way to derive the optical depth of HCN 1-0 in outflowing gas.
- results:
	- The high HCN/H13CN 1-0 line ratio indicates low opacity of HCN 1-0 in the outflowing gas, even though the upper limit of HCN 1-0 opacity obtained here is still not good enough to draw any robust conclusions if HCN 1-0 is optically thin. A lower conversion factor of HCN 1-0 luminosity to dense gas mass in the outflowing gas should be used than that used for the host galaxy of Arp 220.

#### [Complex organic molecules in low-mass protostars on Solar System scales -- II. Nitrogen-bearing species](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03326)
- Questions:
	- Much less is known about the formation of N-bearing species in ices. Nitrogen-bearing molecules are important as nitrogen is a crucial element in developing biomolecules such as amino acids and nucleobases, and they are thus essential for the emergence of life. N-bearing COMs have been detected in high-mass (e.g. Isokoski et al. 2013; Belloche et al. 2016; Bøgelund et al. 2019b; Csengeri et al. 2019; Ligterink et al. 2020) and lowmass protostars (e.g. Bottinelli et al. 2008; Ligterink et al. 2018; Marcelino et al. 2018; Calcutt et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2019; Belloche et al. 2020). In order to elucidate the formation pathways to N-bearing COMs, more observational constraints on their abundances are needed. D/H values provide clues on the temperature at which N-bearing COMs are formed, and thus on their formation history (Taquet et al. 2012, 2014; Furuya et al. 2016). To assess whether many of the N- and O-bearing COMs are indeed produced in ices, a smoking gun would be to detect their ice features directly at mid-infrared wavelengths. (ice species JWST). One of the most well-studied low-mass protostars in complex chemistry is IRAS 16293-2422 (hereafter IRAS 16293), which
was investigated as part of the ALMA Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS) programme (Jørgensen et al. 2016). The PILS gives the most complete inventory of nitrogen- and oxygen-bearing COMs in low-mass protostars to date (Coutens
et al. 2016; Ligterink et al. 2017; Ligterink et al. 2018; Calcutt et al. 2018; Manigand et al. 2020). Jørgensen et al. (2018) and Manigand et al. (2020) suggest that there are two categories for O-bearing and N-bearing species: Some molecules desorb at temperatures of ∼100 K and others at ∼300 K, closer to the central protostar. Apart from IRAS 16293, N-bearing COMs have been observed with ALMA towards a handful of lowmass sources: HH 212 (Lee et al. 2019), NGC 1333 IRAS 4A2
(López-Sepulcre et al. 2017), B1b-S (Marcelino et al. 2018), B335 (Imai et al. 2016), and L483 (Oya et al. 2017). This list has also been supplemented using the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) and its upgraded version, the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA; Taquet et al. 2015; Belloche et al.
2020). (N- O- dichotomy).
- Aims:
	- The aim is to investigate N-bearing complex organic molecules towards two Class 0 protostars (B1-c and S68N) at millimetre wavelengths with ALMA.
- Method:
	- ALMA observations.
- Result:
	- NH2CHO, C2H5CN, HNCO, HN13CO, DNCO, CH3CN, CH2DCN, and CHD2CN are identified towards the investigated sources. Their abundances relative to CH3OH and HNCO are similar for the two sources, with column densities that are typically an order of magnitude lower than those of O-bearing species. The largest variations, of an order of magnitude, are seen for NH2CHO abundance ratios with respect to HNCO and CH3OH and do not correlate with the protostellar luminosity. In addition, within uncertainties, the N-bearing species have similar excitation temperatures to those of O-bearing species (∼ 100 ∼ 300 K). The similarity of most abundances with respect to HNCO, including those of CH2DCN and CHD2CN, hints at a shared chemical history, especially the high D/H ratio in cold regions prior to star formation. However, some of the variations in abundances may reflect the sensitivity of the chemistry to local conditions such as temperature (e.g. NH2CHO), while others may arise from differences in the emitting areas of the molecules linked to their different binding energies in the ice. The two sources discussed here add to the small number of sources with such a detailed chemical analysis on Solar System scales. Future JWST data will allow a direct comparison between the ice and gas abundances of N-bearing species.


#### [Anisotropic Turbulence in Position-Position-Velocity Space: Probing Three-Dimensional Magnetic Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02842)
- # B field # turbulence
- Question:
	- Direct measurements of three-dimensional magnetic fields in the interstellar medium (ISM) are not achievable. However, the anisotropic nature of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence provides a novel way of tracing the magnetic fields.
- Aims:
	- determine 3D B field.
- Method:
	- Guided by the advanced understanding of turbulence's anisotropy in the Position-Position-Velocity (PPV) space, we extend the Structure-Function Analysis (SFA) to measure both the three-dimensional magnetic field orientation and Alfven Mach number MA, which provides the information on magnetic field strength.
- progress:
	- Following the theoretical framework developed in Kandel et al. (2016), we find that the anisotropy in a given velocity channel is affected by the inclination angle between the 3D magnetic field direction and the line-of-sight as well as media magnetization. We analyze the synthetic PPV cubes generated by incompressible and compressible MHD simulations. We confirm that the PPV channel's intensity fluctuations measured in various position angles reveal plane-of-the-sky magnetic field orientation. We show that by varying the channel width, the anisotropies of the intensity fluctuations in PPV space can be used to simultaneously estimate both magnetic field inclination angle and strength of total magnetic fields.

#### [Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-Forming Regions (MagMaR) I. Linear Polarized Imaging of the UCHII Region G5.89-0.39](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03331)
- # B field # G5.89-0.39
- Question:
	- The role played by the magnetic fields in each of the processes mentioned above is still not well understood because of the difficulty in their detection and measurement.
- Aims:
	- study the B-field relation with the star formation processes.
- Method:
	- ALMA continuum observations. 
- progress:
	- Its millimeter emission shows a dusty belt with a mass of 55-115 M and 4,500 au in radius, surrounding an inner part comprising mostly ionized gas with a dust emission only accounting about 30% of the total millimeter emission.The polarization fraction is ∼ 4.4% in the filaments and 2.1% at the shell. The magnetic fields are along the North Filament and perpendicular to the South Filament. In the Central Shell, the magnetic fields are roughly radial in a ring surrounding the dusty belt between 4,500 and 7,500 au, similar to the pattern recently found in the surroundings of Orion BN/KL. This may be an independent observational signpost of explosive dispersal outflows and should be further investigated in other regions. (explosive outflows reported toward this source).

#### [Probing the structure of a massive filament: ArTeMiS 350 and 450 micron mapping of the integral-shaped filament in Orion A](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03717)
- # filament # Orion A
- Question:
	- It is an ideal target to investigate the detailed structure of massive star-forming filaments at high resolution and the relevance of the filament paradigm for the earliest stages of intermediate- to high-mass star formation.
- Aims:
	- Our aim is to characterize the structure of this massive filament at moderately high angular resolution (800 or ∼ 0.016 pc), in order to measure the intrinsic width of the main filament, down to scales well below 0.1 pc, identified as the characteristic width of filaments.
- Method:
	- We used the ArTéMiS bolometer camera at APEX to map a ∼0.6×0.2 deg2
region covering OMC-1, OMC-2, OMC-3 at 350 and 450 µm.
- Progress:
	- We measure intrinsic half-power widths in the range 0.06 to 0.11 pc. This is significantly larger than the Gaussian widths measured for fibers seen in N2H+, which probably traces only the dense innermost regions of the large-scale filament. These half-power widths are within a factor of two of the value of ∼ 0.1 pc found for a large sample of nearby filaments in various low-mass star-forming regions, which tends to indicate that the physical conditions governing the fragmentation of prestellar cores within transcritical or supercritical filaments are the same over a large range of masses per unit length.

#### [Investigating the role of magnetic fields in star formation using molecular line profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03987)
- # B field
- Question:
	- Determining the importance of magnetic fields in star forming environments is hampered by the difficulty of accurately measuring both field strength and gas properties in molecular clouds.
- Aims:
	- study B field using molecular line profiles
- Method:
	- We post-process three-dimensional non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of prestellar cores with a time-dependent chemical network, and use radiative transfer modelling to calculate self-consistent molecular line profiles.
- Progress:
	- Varying the initial mass-to-flux ratio from sub- to super-critical results in significant changes to both the intensity and shape of several observationally important molecular lines. We identify the peak intensity ratio of N2H+ to CS lines, and the CS J=2−1 blue-to-red peak intensity ratio, as promising diagnostics of the initial mass-to-flux ratio, with N2H+/CS values of >0.6 (<0.2) and CS blue/red values of <3 (>5) indicating subcritical (supercritial) collapse. These criteria suggest that, despite presently being magnetically supercritical, L1498 formed from subcritical initial conditions.
- Note:
	- This is interesing. Because N2H+ and CS are easily accessible, one can use the line ratios to do such a comparison.

#### [A PPMAP analysis of the filamentary structures in Ophiuchus L1688 and L1689](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04007)
- # filament # Ophiuchus
- Question:
	- Overall filament structures in Ophiuchus.
- Aim:
	- study the filament networks.
- Method:
	- We use the PPMAP (Point Process MAPping) algorithm to re-analyse the \textit{Herschel} and SCUBA-2 observations of the L1688 and L1689 sub-regions of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud. PPMAP delivers maps with high resolution (here 14'', corresponding to ∼0.01pc at ∼140pc), by using the observations at their native resolutions. PPMAP also delivers more accurate dust optical depths, by distinguishing dust of different types and at different temperatures.
- Progress:
	- The dust temperature, T, tends to be correlated with the dust opacity index, β, with low T and low β tend concentrated in the interiors of filaments. There is some evidence from ammonia observations that the gas is significantly warmer than this, and we cannot rule out the possibility of additional support from turbulence and/or magnetic fields. On the basis of their spatial distribution, we argue that most of the starless cores are likely to disperse (rather than evolving to become prestellar).

#### [The CH radical at radio wavelengths: Revisiting emission in the 3.3GHz ground state lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04259)
- # CH
- Question:
	- The intensities of the three widely observed radio-wavelength hyperfine structure (HFS) lines between the {\Lambda}-doublet components of the rotational ground state of CH are inconsistent with LTE and indicate ubiquitous population inversion. While this can be qualitatively understood assuming a pumping cycle that involves collisional excitation processes, the relative intensities of the lines and in particular the dominance of the lowest frequency satellite line has not been well understood. This has limited the use of CH radio emission as a tracer of the molecular interstellar medium.
- Aims:
	- Establish CH as a good tracer to study the molecular interstellar medium. 
- Method:
	- We present the first interferometric observations, with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, of the CH 9 cm ground state HFS transitions at 3.264 GHz, 3.335 GHz, and 3.349 GHz toward four high mass star-forming regions (SFRs) Sgr B2 (M), G34.26+0.15, W49 (N), and W51.
- Progress:
	- We investigate the nature of the (generally) weak CH ground state masers by employing synergies between the ground state HFS transitions themselves and with the far-infrared lines, near 149 {\mu}m (2 THz), that connect these levels to an also HFS split rotationally excited level. Employing recently calculated collisional rate coefficients, we perform statistical equilibrium calculations with the non-LTE radiative transfer code MOLPOP-CEP in order to model the excitation conditions traced by the ground state HFS lines of CH and to infer the physical conditions in the emitting regions while also accounting for the effects of far-infrared line overlap.
- Note:
	- CH might be a good tracer of the warm intermediary PDR, or turbulent dissipation
regions (TDR) layers alongside CH2.

#### [SOFIA FEEDBACK survey: exploring the dynamics of the stellar wind driven shell of RCW 49](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04276)
- # RCW 49 # SOFIA FEEDBACK
- Question:
	-  The dynamics and feedback of HII regions are not well understood. 
- Aim:
	- study the feedback of RCW49
- Method:
	- SOIFA [CII] and APEX 12CO/13CO (3-2) observations. 
- Progress:
	-  we disentangle the shell from a complex set of individual components of gas centered around RCW 49. We find that the shell of radius ~ 6 pc is expanding at a velocity of 13 km/s toward the observer. The shell has a well defined eastern arc, while the western side is blown open and is venting plasma further into the west. Though the stellar cluster, which is ~ 2 Myr old gave rise to the shell, it only gained momentum relatively recently as we calculate the shell's expansion lifetime ~ 0.27 Myr, making the Wolf-Rayet star WR20a a likely candidate responsible for the shell's re-acceleration.

#### [First detection of doubly deuterated methyl acetylene (CHD2CCH and CH2DCCD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04374)
- # L483 # Chemistry
- Question:
	 -Multiply deuterated molecules allow to put constraints on the deuteration mechanism, either in the gas phase or in the surface of dust grains, and by extension on the formation process of the precursor hydrogenated molecule. If deuterium fractionation occurs in the gas phase, the resulting abundance ratios between singly, doubly, and even triply deuterated forms of a given molecule vary depending on the abundances of H2D+, D2H+,and D3+ and the efficiency of the reactions of deuteron transfer from these ions, which in turn depend on parameters like the gas kinetic temperature, the level of CO depletion, and the ortho-to-para ratio of H2 (Roberts et al. 2004; Roueff et al. 2005; Flower et al. 2006). If deuteration occurs on grains surfaces, the relative abundances of the different deuterated forms of a molecule are expected to follow a statistical pattern as they should basically depend on the relative arrival rates on grains of D and H atoms from the gas phase and thus on the abundance ratio between atomic D and H in the gas phase (Brown & Millar 1989). --need to be read
- Aim:
	- detect multiply deuterated molecules. 
- Method:
	- IRAM 30m 72-116 GHz line survey.
- Progress:
	- First detection of doubly deuterated methyl acetylene (CHD2CCH and CH2DCCD). Deuterium fractionation of CH3CCH in L483. The abundance ratios CH2DCCH/CH3CCD = 3.0 +/- 0.9 and CHD2CCH/CH2DCCD = 1.25 +/- 0.37 observed in L483 are consistent with the statistically expected values of three and one.

#### [Observational Evidence for a Thick Disk of Dark Molecular Gas in the Outer Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06538)
- # outer galaxy # galactic structure
- Question:
	- We present the serendipitous discovery of an extremely broad (ΔVLSR∼150 km/s), faint (Tmb<10mK), and ubiquitous 1667 and 1665 MHz ground-state thermal OH emission towards the 2nd quadrant of the outer Galaxy (Rgal > 8 kpc) with the Green Bank Telescope.
- Aim:
	- better constrain the discovered galactic componnet.
- Method:
	- GBT OH observations. 
- Progress:
	-  Our results imply the existence of a thick (-200< z < 200 pc) disk of diffuse (nH2 ~ 5 × 10−3 cm−3) molecular gas in the Outer Galaxy previously undetected in all-sky CO surveys.

#### [Identification of prestellar cores in high-mass star forming clumps via H2D+ observations with ALMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06431)
- # H2D+ # prestellar cores
- Question:
	- The different theoretical models concerning the formation of high-mass stars make distinct predictions regarding their progenitors, i.e. the high-mass prestellar cores. However, so far no conclusive observation of such objects has been made.
- Aim:
	- We aim to study the very early stages of high-mass star formation in two infrared-dark, massive clumps, to identify the core population that they harbour.
- Method:
	- ALMA observations of continuum emission at 0.8mm and of the ortho-H2D+ transition at 372GHz towards the two clumps.
- Progress:
	- We report for the first time the detection of ortho-H2D+ in high-mass star-forming regions performed with an interferometer. Our data confirm that ortho-H2D+ is an ideal tracer of cold and dense gas. Interestingly, almost all the H2D+-identified cores are less massive than 13M_sun , with the exception of one core in AG354. Furthermore, most of them are subvirial and larger than their Jeans masses. These results are difficult to explain in the context of the turbulent accretion models, which predict massive and virialised prestellar cores.


#### [A Low-mass Cold and Quiescent Core Population in a Massive Star Protocluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05493)
- # protocluster # cluster formaiton
- Question:
	- Pre-stellar cores represent the initial conditions of star formation. Although these initial conditions in nearby low-mass star-forming regions have been investigated in detail, such initial conditions remain vastly unexplored for massive star-forming regions.
- Aims:
	- Study the pretellar core populations in massive protoclusters.
- Method:
	- The ALMA observations at a ∼0.02 pc spatial resolution.
- Progress:
	- we identified 17 low-mass starless core candidates that do not show any evidence of protostellar activity. These candidates present small velocity dispersions, high fractional abundances of NH2D, high NH3 deuterium fractionations, and are completely dark in the infrared wavelengths from 3.6 up to 70~μm. Turbulence is significantly dissipated and the gas kinematics are dominated by thermal motions toward these candidates. Nine out of the 17 cores are gravitationally bound, and therefore are identified as pre-stellar core candidates. The embedded cores of NGC6334S show a wide diversity in masses and evolutionary stages.


#### [The Extraordinary Outburst in the Massive Protostellar System NGC6334I-MM1: Strong Increase in Mid-Infrared Continuum Emission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05187)
- # NGC 6334 # maser flare # accretion burst
- Question:
	- In recent years, dramatic outbursts have been identified toward massive protostars via infrared and millimeter dust continuum and molecular maser emission. The longest lived outburst (>6 yr) persists in NGC6334I-MM1, a deeply-embedded object with no near-IR counterpart. Using FORCAST and HAWC+ on SOFIA, we have obtained the first mid-infrared images of this field since the outburst began.
- Aims:
	- Study the variability of FIR.
- Method:
	- SOFIA FIR imaging.
- Progress:
	- Despite being undetected in pre-outburst ground-based 18 μm images, MM1 is now the brightest region at all three wavelengths (25, 37, and 53 μm), exceeding the ultracompact HII region MM3 (NGC6334F). Combining the SOFIA data with ALMA imaging at four wavelengths, we construct a spectral energy distribution of the combination of MM1 and the nearby hot core MM2. The best-fit Robitaille radiative transfer model yields a luminosity of (4.9±0.8)×104L⊙. Accounting for an estimated pre-outburst luminosity ratio MM1:MM2 = 2.1±0.4, the luminosity of MM1 has increased by a factor of 16.3±4.4. The pre-outburst luminosity implies a protostar of mass 6.7 M⊙, which can produce the ionizing photon rate required to power the pre-outburst hypercompact HII region surrounding the likely outbursting protostar MM1B. The total energy and duration of the outburst exceed the S255IR-NIRS3 outburst by a factor of ≳3, suggesting a different scale of event involving expansion of the protostellar photosphere (to ≳ 20 R⊙), thereby supporting a higher accretion rate (≳0.0023 M⊙ yr−1) and reducing the ionizing photon rate. In the grid of hydrodynamic models of Meyer et al. 2021, the combination of outburst luminosity and magnitude (3) places the NGC6334I-MM1 event in the region of moderate total accretion (∼0.1-0.3 M⊙) and hence long duration (∼40-130 yr).

#### [Stellar feedback and triggered star formation in the prototypical bubble RCW 120](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04568)
- # RCW 120 # 
- Question:
	- Radiative and mechanical feedback of massive stars regulates star formation and galaxy evolution. Positive feedback triggers the creation of new stars by collecting dense shells of gas, while negative feedback disrupts star formation by shredding molecular clouds. Although key to understanding star formation, their relative importance is unknown.
- Aims:
	- Determine their relative importance.
- Method:
	- we report velocity-resolved observations from the SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) legacy program FEEDBACK of the massive star-forming region RCW 120 in the [CII] 1.9-THz fine-structure line
- Progress:
	- revealing a gas shell expanding at 15 km/s. Complementary APEX (Atacama Pathfinder Experiment) CO J=3-2 345-GHz observations exhibit a ring structure of molecular gas, fragmented into clumps that are actively forming stars. Our observations demonstrate that triggered star formation can occur on much shorter time scales than hitherto thought (<0.15 million years), suggesting that positive feedback operates on short time periods.

#### [The Hi-GAL compact source catalogue -- II. The 360° catalogue of clump physical properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04807)
- # HIGAL # all-sky clumps
- Questions:
	- Herschel SPIRE/PACS galactic plane survey.
- Aims:
	- detect all clumps in the galactic plane.
- Method:
	- Herschel HIGAL survey.
- Progress:
	- We present the 360∘ catalogue of physical properties of Hi-GAL compact sources, detected between 70 and 500 μm. This release not only completes the analogous catalogue previously produced by the Hi-GAL collaboration for −71∘≲ℓ≲67∘, but also meaningfully improves it thanks to a new set of heliocentric distances, 120808 in total. About a third of the 150223 entries are located in the newly added portion of the Galactic plane.
- Note: a nice catalogue for machine learning methods. 


#### [Merging Filaments I: A race against collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04541)
- # filament # merging
- Questions:
	- The interstellar medium is characterised by an intricate filamentary network which exhibits complex structures. These show a variety of different shapes (e.g. junctions, rings, etc.) deviating strongly from the usually assumed cylindrical shape. A possible formation mechanism are filament mergers which we analyse in this study. 
- Aims:
	- undertand filament formation.
- Method:
	- We develop an analytic formula for the merging and core-formation timescale at the edge and validate our model via hydrodynamical simulations with the adaptive-mesh-refinement-code RAMSES.
- Progress:
	- Indeed, the proximity of filaments in networks suggests mergers to be rather likely. As the merger has to be faster than the end dominated collapse of the filament along its major axis we expect three possible results: (a) The filaments collapse before a merger can happen, (b) the merged filamentary complex shows already signs of cores at the edges or (c) the filaments merge into a structure which is not end-dominated. This allows us to predict the outcome of a filament merger, given different initial conditions which are the initial distance and the respective line-masses of each filament as well as their relative velocities.

#### [The Perseus ALMA Chemistry Survey (PEACHES). I. The Complex Organic Molecules in Perseus Embedded Protostars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11009)
- # COM # Perseus # protostars
- Questions:
	- To date, about two dozen low-mass embedded protostars exhibit rich spectra with lines of complex organic molecule (COM). These protostars seem to possess different enrichment in COMs. However, the statistics of COM abundance in low-mass protostars are limited by the scarcity of observations.
- Aims:
	- This study introduces the Perseus ALMA Chemistry Survey (PEACHES), which aims at unbiasedly characterizing the chemistry of COMs toward the embedded (Class 0/I) protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud.
- Method:
	- ALMA observations.
- Progress:
	- Of 50 embedded protostars surveyed, 58% of them have emission from COMs. A 56%, 32%, and 40% of the protostars have CH3OH, CH3OCHO, and N-bearing COMs, respectively. The detectability of COMs depends neither on the averaged continuum brightness temperature, a proxy of the H2 column density, nor on the bolometric luminosity and the bolometric temperature. For the protostars with detected COMs, CH3OH has a tight correlation with CH3CN, spanning more than two orders of magnitude in column densities normalized by the continuum brightness temperature, suggesting a chemical relation between CH3OH and CH3CN and a large chemical diversity in the PEACHES samples at the same time. A similar trend with more scatter is also found between all identified COMs, hinting at a common chemistry for the sources with COMs. The correlation between COMs is insensitive to the protostellar properties, such as the bolometric luminosity and the bolometric temperature. The abundance of larger COMs (CH3OCHO and CH3OCH3) relative to that of smaller COMs (CH3OH and CH3CN) increases with the inferred gas column density, hinting at an efficient production of complex species in denser envelopes.

#### [Thiols in the ISM: first detection of HC(O)SH and confirmation of C2H5SH](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08036)
- # G+0.693-0.027 
- Question:
	- The chemical compounds carrying the thiol group (-SH) have been considered essential in recent prebiotic studies regarding the polymerization of amino acids.
- Aims:
	- We have searched for this kind of compounds toward the Galactic Centre quiescent cloud G+0.693-0.027. 
- Method:
	- IRAM 30m +Yebes 40 m.
- Progress:
	- We report the first detection in the interstellar space of the trans-isomer of monothioformic acid (t-HC(O)SH) with an abundance of ∼1×10−10. Additionally, we provide a solid confirmation of the gauche isomer of ethyl mercaptan (g-C2H5SH) with an abundance of ∼3×10−10, and we also detect methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) with an abundance of ∼5×10−9. Abundance ratios were calculated for the three SH-bearing species and their OH-analogues, revealing similar trends between alcohols and thiols with increasing complexity. 

#### [Influence of the nano-grain depletion in photon-dominated regions: Application to the gas physics and chemistry in the Horsehead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08204)
- # hoursehead # PDR
- Question:
	- The large disparity in physical conditions from the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) to denser clouds such as photon-dominated regions (PDRs) triggers an evolution of the dust properties (i.e. composition, size, and shape). The gas physics and chemistry are tightly connected to these dust properties and are therefore affected by dust evolution and especially the nano-grain depletion in the outer irradiated part of PDRs. 
- Aims:
	- We highlight the influence of nano-grain depletion on the gas physics and chemistry in the Horsehead nebula, a prototypical PDR. 
- Method:
	- We used a model for atomic and molecular gas in PDRs, the Meudon PDR code, using diffuse ISM-like dust and Horsehead-like dust to study the influence of nano-grain depletion on the gas physics and chemistry, focusing on the impact on photoelectric heating and H2 formation and, therefore, on the H2 gas lines.
- Progress:
	- The nano-grain depletion in photon-dominated regions will strongly affects gas heating through the photoelectric effect and thus the gas temperature and the H2 formation, hence the H -> H2 position.
Our understanding of the excitation of H2 and/or of heating processes in the Horsehead, and more generally in PDRs, is still incomplete.


#### [Observed CN and HCN intensity ratios exhibit subtle variations in extreme galaxy environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08224)
- # CN # HCN
- Question:
	- We use both new and archival ALMA data of three energy lines each of CN and HCN to explore intensity ratios in dense gas. CN is thus thought to preferentially form in regions illuminated by intense radiation fields, including the ultra-violet (UV) radiation fields of photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) surrounding massive stars.
- Aims:
	- Galaxies with starbursts and/or AGN are prime environments for probing CN and HCN and their interactions with radiation fields.
- Method:
	- ALMA archival observations. 
- Progress:
	- CN is a viable tracer of dense gas in galaxies. Using the molecular abundances, we will be able to compare our results to models predicting CN/HCN abundance ratios and further explore the effects of radiation fields on molecular gas properties.

#### [Detection of Complex Organic Molecules in Young Starless Core L1521E](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07683)
- # L1521E # COM
- Question:
	- Determining the level of chemical complexity within dense starless and gravitationally bound prestellar cores is crucial for constructing chemical models, which subsequently constrain the initial chemical conditions of star formation.
- Aims:
	- searched for complex organic molecules (COMs) in the young starless core L1521E.
- Method:
	- ARO 12M OBSERVATIONS of COMS.
- Progress:
	- report the first clear detection of dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3), methyl formate (HCOOCH3), and vinyl cyanide (CH2CHCN) in L1521E. We calculated L1521E COM abundances and compared them to other stages of low-mass star formation, also finding similarities to other starless/prestellar cores, suggesting related chemical evolution.

	- O-bearing COMs are poor in TMC1. 
- Aims:
	- Detect new O-bearing COMs.
- Method:
	- the Yebes 40m telescope
- Progress:
	- We report the detection of the oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules propenal (C2H3CHO), vinyl alcohol (C2H3OH), methyl formate (HCOOCH3), and dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3) toward the cyanopolyyne peak of the starless core TMC-1.

#### [Fast outflows in protoplanetary nebulae and young planetary nebulae observed by Herschel/HIFI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10209)
- # PN # outflows
- Question:
	- Fast outflows and their interaction with slow shells (generally known as the fossil circumstellar envelope of asymptotic giant branch stars) play an important role in the structure and kinematics of protoplanetary and planetary nebulae (pPNe, PNe). To properly study their effects within these objects, we also need to observe the intermediate-temperature gas, which is only detectable in the far-infrared (FIR) and submillimetre (submm) transitions.
- Aims:
	- We study the physical conditions of the outflows presented in a number of pPNe and PNe, with a focus on their temperature and excitation states.
- Method:
	- We carried out Herschel/HIFI observations in the submm lines of 12CO in nine pPNe and nine PNe and complemented them with low-J CO spectra obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope and taken from the literature. The spectral resolution of HIFI allows us to identify and measure the different nebular components in the line profiles. The comparison with large velocity gradient (LVG) model predictions was used to estimate the physical conditions of the warm gas in the nebulae, such as excitation conditions, temperature, and density.
- Progress:
	- We found high kinetic temperatures for the fast winds of pPNe, typically reaching between 75 K and 200 K. In contrast, the high-velocity gas in the sampled PNe is colder, with characteristic temperatures between 25 K and 75 K, and it is found in a lower excitation state. We interpret this correlation of the kinetic temperature and excitation state of fast outflows with the amount of time elapsed since their acceleration (probably driven by shocks) as a consequence of the cooling that occurred during the pPN phase.

#### [Efficiently Cooled Stellar Wind Bubbles in Turbulent Clouds I. Fractal Theory and Application to Star-Forming Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07691)
- # bubble # fractal
- Question:
	- Winds from massive stars have velocities of 1000 km s−1 or more, and produce hot, high pressure gas when they shock. 
- Aims:
	- We develop a theory for the evolution of bubbles driven by the collective winds from star clusters early in their lifetimes, which involves interaction with the turbulent, dense interstellar medium of the surrounding natal molecular cloud.
- Method:
	- 
- Progress:
	- A key feature is the fractal nature of the hot bubble’s surface. Our theory explains the weak X-ray emission and low shell expansion velocities of observed sources.


#### [Discovery of the Pure Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Indene (c-C9H8) with GOTHAM Observations of TMC-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15117)
- # TMC1 
- progress: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) have long been invoked in the study of interstellar and protostellar sources, but the unambiguous identification of any individual PAH has proven elusive until very recently. As a result, the formation mechanisms for this important class of molecules remain poorly constrained. Here we report the first interstellar detection of a pure hydrocarbon PAH, indene (C9H8), as part of the GBT Observations of TMC-1

- progress: One set of calculations is based on an escape-probability formalisms that uses numerical approximations derived in the early-eighties. The accuracy of these approximations is investigated and it is shown that they are less accurate than claimed. Improved formalism are derived. Nevertheless, the changes in CO envelope size are small to moderate, less than 2\% for models with 10−7<M˙<10−4 \msolyr\ and at most 7\% for model with M˙=10−8 \msolyr.

#### [ALMA observations of doubly deuterated water: Inheritance ofwater from the prestellar environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13411)
- # water # Class 0 sources B335 and L483
- progress: Establishing the origin of the water D/H ratio in the Solar System is central to our understanding of the chemical trail of water during the star and planet formation process. In addition, the observed D2O/H2O ratios support an observed dichotomy in the deuterium fractionation of water toward isolated and clustered protostars. The high D2O/HDO ratios are a strong indication of chemical inheritance of water from the prestellar phase down to the inner warm envelope. This implies that the local cloud conditions in the prestellar phase, such as temperatures and timescales, determine the water chemistry at later stages and could provide a source of chemical differentiation in young systems.

	- a 1.1~mm light curve of Sgr A* showing an outburst of 140% maximum amplitude on 9th May, 2014 but otherwise only stochastic variations of 10% and no systematic long-term change, consistent with other observations. There is a remarkable trend of increasing dust spectral index β, from 2.0−2.4, toward dense peaks in the CMZ, indicating a deficiency of large grains or a fundamental change in dust optical properties. 

#### [Giant Molecular Cloud Formation at the Interface of Colliding Supershells in the Large Magellanic Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14191)
- # LMC
- Progress:
	- The star-forming regions N48 and N49 are located within the high column density Hi ridge between two kpc-scale supergiant shells, LMC 4 and LMC 5. It is newly revealed that the Hi gas is highly filamentary, and that the molecular clumps are distributed along filamentary Hi features. In total 39 filamentary features are identified and their typical width is ~ 21 (8-49) [pc]. We propose a scenario in which the GMCs were formed via gravitational instabilities in atomic gas which was initially accumulated by the two shells and then further compressed by their collision. This suggests that GMC formation involves the filamentary nature of the atomic medium.

#### [Feedback from an O star formed in a filament](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15017)
- # filament
- Progress:
	- We show that for a wide range of these configuration parameters, ionising radiation from the O star rapidly erodes the filament, and the ionised gas from the filament disperses into the surroundings.  In particular we show that, for very large R_FIL and/or large n_FIL and/or low Ndot_LyC, continuing accretion onto the filament might trap the ionising radiation from the O star, slowing the erosion of the filament even further.

#### [Comparing absorption from classic tracers of the diffuse interstellar medium at optical and radio wavelengths along the same sightlines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.15013)
- # diffuse interstellar medium
- Progress:
	- The atoms traced optically are all heavily depleted compared to a Solar abundance. In the only direction with a measured CH+ profile, a 2 km s−1 velocity shift between CH+
and CH, usually interpreted as the sign of shocked gas, is intriguingly mimicked in the shift of HI relative to HCO+.
