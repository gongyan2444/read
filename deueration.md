## Deuteration

#### [A Survey of Deuterated Ammonia in the Cepheus Star-Forming Region L1251](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10718)
- Question: 
	- Understanding the chemical processes during starless core and prestellar core evolution is an important step in understanding the initial stages of star and disk formation. Deteratium fraction is thought to be a good tracer of evolutionary stages. There are a lack of surveys that focus on the chemistry of the entire dense core population within a single cloud.  
- Method:
	- ARO 12m o-NH2D at 85.9 GHz. 
- Aims: 
	- To quantify HI/H2 abundance ratio.
- results:
	- The peak intensity is as high as 0.4 K (Tmb). Abundances are calculated with the herschel  H2 column density. They estimate B from equations. the chemical dichotomy in prestellar cores? 
-Comments:
	- They used a non-unity filling fraction for analysis. Deuterated fraction of the whole cloud is even more fancy.
