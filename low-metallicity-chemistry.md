#### [CHEMOUT: CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy. I. Organic molecules and tracers of star-formation activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00719)
- Question:
        - Because of lower metallicity in the outer galaxy, the chemistry is expected to be different from inner galaxy. However, this has never been throughfully tested.	
- Aims:
        - metallicity dependence of chemistry
- new method:
        - IRAM 30m survey of star formation regions at 3 mm. 
- progress:
        - They detect simple organic species HCO+, H13CO+, HCN, c-C3H2, HCO, C4H, and HCS+, of the complex hydrocarbon CH3CCH, and of SiO, CCS and SO. It discusses an interesting question about the Galactic Habitable Zone which should have enough heavy elements to form rocky planets and low concentration of high energy. 
- comment:
	- The distance itself is not very accurate, which needs more efforts from parallax measurements. This survey suffers significant beam dilution if they are really far away from the GC. For such studies, higher angular resolution observations should be more feasible to produce fruitful results. 


#### [The Detection of Deuterated Water in the Large Magellanic Cloud with ALMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04325)
- Questions:
	- Chemistry in low metallicity environments. 
- Aim:
	- TO investigate if chemistry is affected by low metallicity.
- results:
	- HDO 211-212 has been detected toward hot cores N105-2A and 2B in the N105 star-forming region. This is the first detection in an extragalactic hot core.


#### [CHEMOUT: CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy III. Nitrogen isotopic ratios in the outer Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10620)
- Questions:
	- The carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios in the outer Galaxy are quite uncertain.
- results:
	- the 14N/15N ratios from HCN and HNC for 14 and 3 sources. An overall linear decreasing H13CN/HC15N ratio with increasing R_GC. This translates to a parabolic 14N/15N ratio with a peak at 11 kpc.
- Comments:
	- The data are quite noisy. More constraints.
