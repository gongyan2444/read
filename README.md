This is designed for myself. This is mostly based on Prof. Zhiyu Zhang's course ([Astronomical Literature  Reading and Writing](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/EN/People/Professors/20200707/i113716.html)). My notes will mainly focus on the fast reading.



##  Rule of thumb (I am trying to follow these tips)
### Fast reading (< 10 minutes)
* Questions
* Aims
* Notes
* new method
* nice figures 
* progress 

### Intensive reading (a few hours, not a few years!!)
#### 5-C rule
* Category: what type? which field?
* Context:  history? questions?
* Correctness: valid assumption? valid approaches?
* Contribution: what is new? highlight?
* Clarity: well-written? worth it?
#### WWH rule
* what was done there?
* why the conclusions are draw? logical!
* How trust-able/robust is it?
#### be like an author
* know all details
* know strong and weak points
* potential issues
* what to follow up?
