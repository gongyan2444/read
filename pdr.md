## CO dark gas

#### [Catching the Birth of a Dark Molecular Cloud for the First Time](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...867...13Z/abstract)
- Question: 
	- The transition from H to H2 is a key step to understand the cloud formation and eventually the cosmic structure. However, quantify H2 formation is quite challenging.
- Aims: 
	- To quantify HI/H2 abundance ratio.


#### [ALMA Datacubes and Continuum Maps of the Irradiated Western Wall in Carina](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10013)

-Question:
	- First view of the subarcsecond scales of PDRs.

comments:
	- really fancy datasets of  12CO, 13CO, C18O, and [C I] for a portion of the G287.38-0.62 (Car 1-E) region in the Carina star-forming complex.
