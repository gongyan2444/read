#### [ALMA Datacubes and Continuum Maps of the Irradiated Western Wall in Carina](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10013)

-Question:
	- First view of the subarcsecond scales of PDRs.

comments:
	- really fancy datasets of  12CO, 13CO, C18O, and [C I] for a portion of the G287.38-0.62 (Car 1-E) region in the Carina star-forming complex.
