#### [The formation of active protoclusters in the Aquila rift: a millimeter continuum view](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...535A..77M/abstract)
- Question: 
	- The earliest phase of cluster formation, the origin of IMF, and the efficiency of the star formation process are still poorly understood. 
- Aims: 
	- To adress the star formation rate, star formation efficiency, typical lifetime of the Class 0 protostellar phase in two nearby cluster-forming clumps, Serpens South and W40.
- new method: 
	- They carried out 1.2 mm dust continuum mapping with the MAMBO bolometer array on the IRAM 30m telescope. They perform a systematic source extraction with multi-scale source extraction method.
- progress: 
	- They discovered 77 continuum sources. The ratio of Class 0 to Class I protostars is as low as 0.19--0.27, supporting fact accretion at the beginning of the the protostellar phase, and leads to a Class 0 lifetime of 4-9e4 yr. Both protoclusters are characterized by large fractions of protostars and high SFRs of 20-50 Msun Myr<sup>-1</sup> pc<sup>-2</sup>.

#### [Distribution of Serpens South protostars revealed with ALMA](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...615A...9P/abstract)
- Question: 
	- Stars are commonly formed in clusters whose members display different degrees of mass segregation. The reason is still not clear.
- Aims: 
	- study the mass and complete members in the Serpens South Cluster.
- new method: 
	- They performed ALMA 1 mm continuum observations toward Serpens South.
- progress: 
	- They discovered 52 continuum sources with mass of 0.0002--0.9 solar mass. They found mass segregation in the deeply embedded sources without IR counterparts. Their results suggest that the reason for mass segregation is likely primordial.   
- note: 
	- They use the minimum spanning tree method to constrain the fragmentation and its concentration.
