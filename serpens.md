#### [The formation of active protoclusters in the Aquila rift: a millimeter continuum view](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011A%26A...535A..77M/abstract)
- Question: 
	- The earliest phase of cluster formation, the origin of IMF, and the efficiency of the star formation process are still poorly understood. 
- Aims: 
	- To adress the star formation rate, star formation efficiency, typical lifetime of the Class 0 protostellar phase in two nearby cluster-forming clumps, Serpens South and W40.
- new method: 
	- They carried out 1.2 mm dust continuum mapping with the MAMBO bolometer array on the IRAM 30m telescope. They perform a systematic source extraction with multi-scale source extraction method.
- progress: 
	- They discovered 77 continuum sources. The ratio of Class 0 to Class I protostars is as low as 0.19--0.27, supporting fact accretion at the beginning of the the protostellar phase, and leads to a Class 0 lifetime of 4-9e4 yr. Both protoclusters are characterized by large fractions of protostars and high SFRs of 20-50 Msun Myr<sup>-1</sup> pc<sup>-2</sup>.

#### [Distribution of Serpens South protostars revealed with ALMA](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...615A...9P/abstract)
- Question: 
	- Stars are commonly formed in clusters whose members display different degrees of mass segregation. The reason is still not clear.
- Aims: 
	- study the mass and complete members in the Serpens South Cluster.
- new method: 
	- They performed ALMA 1 mm continuum observations toward Serpens South.
- progress: 
	- They discovered 52 continuum sources with mass of 0.0002--0.9 solar mass. They found mass segregation in the deeply embedded sources without IR counterparts. Their results suggest that the reason for mass segregation is likely primordial.   
- note: 
	- They use the minimum spanning tree method to constrain the fragmentation and its concentration.

#### [The census of dense cores in the Serpens region from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.500.4257F/abstract)
-Question:
	- How the physical properties of stars are determined during the  prestellar core phase is still a matter of debate. Core mass function is not investigated in the Serpens region.
- Aims: 
	- Characterize the earliest stages of star formation in the Serpens region , and to determine accompanying results about its prestellar core mass function. 
- Method: 
	- Herschel observations.
- Progress:
	- 833 sources, includeing 709 starless cores+124 protostellar cores. CMF with a lognormal up to 2Msun, after which it follows a power law with a slope of -2.05±0.34. The slope is steeper but still compatible with the IMF. 81% prestellar cores lies on filamentary structures. Serpens is confirmed to be a young low-mass  and active star-forming region.
- note:
	- They lack molecular line observations. 


#### [Magnetized filamentary gas flows feeding the young embedded cluster in Serpens South](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NatAs...4.1195P/abstract)
-Question:
	- The specific role of magnetic fields in shaping how the filaments fragment into cores and on to form stars and clusters thus remains unknown.
-Aims:
	- study the role of magnetic field in the formation of star clusters like Serpens South that is one of the nearest star cluster formation region.
-method:
	- SOFIA HAWC+ polarimeter.
- progress:
	- They report the discovery of a further transition in relative orientation, that is, a return to parallel alignment at AV ≳ 21 mag in parts of the Serpens South cloud. This transition appears to be caused by gas flow and indicates that magnetic supercriticality sets in near AV ≳ 21 mag, allowing gravitational collapse and star cluster formation to occur even in the presence of relatively strong magnetic fields.
- Note:
	- At low column densities, the structure aligns parallel with the B field, while the gas structure is typically oriented perpendicular to magnetic fields at higher column densities. The new discovery highlights the role of gravity that can drag the magnetic field lines, which make the B field parallel to the filament again. 



#### [Discovery of 22 GHz Water Masers in the Serpens South Region](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021AJ....162...68O/abstract)
-Question:
	- Hunting for 22 GHz water masers in Serpens south
- Aims:
	- This can be used to measure parallax with VLBI.
- method:
	- VLA and VLBA observations.
- progress:
	- We discover three 22 GHz Water masers that are associated with class 0-I stars and one is likely due to an O-rich AGB star. CARMA-6 may undergo a flare event. The linear velocity gradient of CARMA6 indicates a rotating jet. Both CARMA6 and CARMA6 seem to show episodic accretion. CARMA6 in the cluster becomes a very interesting source which deserves further investigations. 
	
#### [B-FIELDS IN STAR-FORMING REGION OBSERVATIONS (BISTRO): MAGNETIC FIELDS IN THE FILAMENTARY STRUCTURES OF SERPENS MAIN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05059)
-Question:
	- The role of B field in Serpens Main.
- Aims:
	- probe the magnetic field morphology of the Serpens Main on about 6000 au scales. 
- method:
	- JCMT SCUBA 850 micro polarimetric observations. They used HRO technique to study the relative orientation between B field and density structure. 
- progress:
	- transition column densities at 0.93e22, 4.6e22, 16e22 cm-2. This result is similar to Pillai+2021. B_pos is about 60-300 mircoGauss.
