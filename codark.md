## CO dark gas

#### [Standing in the shadow of dark gas: ALMA observations of absorption from dark CO in the molecular dark neutral medium of Chamaeleon](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...627A..95L/abstract)
- Question: 
	- They detect 89.2 GHz HCO+ absorption in 12 directions but did not detect CO emission in the outskirts of the Chamaeleon cloud. Five sightlines had little dark neutral medium but have HCO+ absorption. 
- Aims: 
	- To determine CO column density of the five sightlines and determine why CO emission was not detected.
- new method: 
	- ALMA more sensitive observations of CO and HCO+ toward quasars.
- progress: 
	- CO absorption is detected in all five sightlines. Previous nondetection is the sensitivity issue. CO column density is rather low < 1e15 cm<sup>-2</sup>.
