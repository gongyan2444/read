#### [Feedback in Forming Star Clusters: The Mass-Radius Relation and Mass Function of Molecular Clumps in the Large Magellanic Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12260)
- # Mass-radius relation
- Question: 
	- The mass-size relation in the external galaxies are not studied. This is now feasible with ALMA toward clumps in LMC.
- Aims: 
	- To study the mass-size relation in LMC.
- method: 
	- They used the dendrogram-based catalog of clumps compiled by Wong et al. from 12CO and 13CO maps of six giant molecular clouds in the LMC observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). 
- progress: 
	- They find that the mass-radius relation and mass function of LMC clumps have power-law forms, R∝Mα and dN/dM∝Mβ, with indices α=0.36±0.03 and β=−1.8±0.1 over the mass ranges 102M⊙≲M≲105M⊙ and 102M⊙≲M≲104M⊙, respectively. The derived β is consistent with the simple feedback model proposed by Fall, Krumholz, and Matzner. They conclude that the situation portrayed here for clumps and clusters in the LMC replicates that in the Milky Way.

#### [Dark Supernova Remnants revealed by CO-line Bubbles in the W43 Molecular Complex along the 4-kpc Arm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00592)
- # W43 # SNR 
- Question:
	- Currently, about 300 SNRs have been detected in the Milky Way, but the number is still far from the completeness. New methods are needed to find the SNRs in the Milky Way.
- Aims: 
	- Find dark SNRs in the Milky Way.
- Method: 
	- Use CO data to find the dark SNRs.
- Progress:
	- They found CO bubbles in W43. The CO bubbles are interpreted as due to fully evolved buried SNRs in molecular clouds after rapid exhaustion of the released energy in dense molecular clouds. The CO bubbles may be a direct evidence for exciting and maintaining the turbulence in GMCs by SN origin. Search for CO bubbles as "dark SNRs" (dSNR) will have implication to estimate the supernova rate more accurately, and hence the star formation activity in the Milky Way.
- Note: 
	- They used a background filter to detect the clumps and filaments in CO data.

#### [The AMBRE Project: Origin and evolution of sulfur in the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01961)
- # sulfur # Chemical evolution
- Question:
	- Sulfur is a volatile chemical element that plays an important role in tracing the chemical evolution of galaxies. However, its nucleosynthesis origin and abundance variations are still unclear.
- Aims:
	- to accurately and precisely study the S-content of large number of stars located in the solar neighbourhood.
- Method:
	- We use the parametrisation of thousands of HR stellar spectra provided by the AMBRE Project, and combine it with the automated abundance determination GAUGUIN to derive LTE sulfur abundances for 1855 slow-rotating FGK-type stars.
- Progress:
	- The [S/M] abundances ratio is compatible with a plateau-like distribution in the metal-poor regime, and then starts to decrease continuously at [M/H]~-1.0dex. This decrease continues towards negative values for supersolar metallicity stars as recently reported for Mg and as predicted by Galactic chemical evolution models. Moreover, sulfur-rich stars having [M/H] in the range [-1.0,-0.5] have very different kinematical and orbital properties with respect to more metal-rich and sulfur-poor ones. Two disc components, associated with the thin and thick discs, are thus seen independently in kinematics and sulfur abundances. the enrichment in sulfur with respect to iron is nicely correlated with stellar ages: older metal-poor stars have higher [S/M] ratios than younger metal-rich ones. This work has confirmed that sulfur is an alfa-element that could be considered to explore the Galactic populations properties.
- Note:
	- The sulfur isotopic ratio can be estimated with H2S, CS etc.

#### [HII regions and high-mass starless clump candidates II. Fragmentation and induced star formation at ~0.025 pc scale: An ALMA continuum study](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201207738Z/abstract)
- # Fragmentation # Triggered star formation
- Question:
	- The feedback of HII regions may alter the properties in the surrounding gas. The question of whether the presence of HII regions modifies the core-scale fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored.
- Aims:
	- They aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by HII regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted HMSCs. 
- Method:
	-  Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum with a resolution of ~1.3", we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by HII regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. 
- Progress:
	- The feedback seems not to affect the fragmentation, but shape the morphology. They found two-level hierarchical features.. 
- Note:
	- See more details of the ACR method on the “multimode” package in Ameijeiras-Alonso et al. (2018).

#### [The connection between warm carbon chain chemistry and interstellar irradiation of star-forming cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02681)
- # carbon chain # irradiation 
- Question:
	- WCCC is promoted in star-forming cores exposed to radiation from the interstellar medium. Irradiation is only one possible cause or prerequisite for WCCC.. However, this is not confirmed by models. 
- Aims:
	- to qualitatively investigate the chemistry of carbon chains in star-forming cores irradiated from outside by comparing the chemistry of carbon chains in a shielded cloud core and in a core exposed to radiation. In this way, we aim to understand, if outside irradiation can facilitate the formation of a WCCC core.
- Method:
	- the astrochemical model to test the hypothesis.
- Progress:
	- In the full irradiation model, the abundances of carbon chains were found to be higher by a factor of few to few hundred, compared to the model with low irradiation. Higher carbon-chain abundances in the prestellar stage and, presumably, in the extended circumstellar envelope, arise because of irradiation of gas and dust by interstellar photons and cosmic rays. They suggest that WCCC can be caused by exposure of a star-forming core to interstellar radiation, or even just to cosmic rays.
- Note: 
	- PDR seems to account for WCCC!!!

#### [GASTON: Galactic Star Formation with NIKA2. Evidence for the mass growth of star-forming clumps](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.tmp..241R/abstract)
- # NIKA2 # 1.15 mm continuum survey
- Question:
	- The formation of high-mass star formation is still not well known. Two popular mechanisms (core-fed and clump fed) are proposed. In core fed mode, MYSOs accretes material from a compact (<=0.1 pc) fixed mass reservoir. In clump fed mode, MYSOs grow in mass as a result of large scale and hierarchical gravitational collapse of its parent molecular clump (>=1 pc). The transition between high-mass and low-mass star-forming modes are also poorly constrained. 
- Aims: Determine the mechanism of high-mass star formation. Search for signatures of the transition between the high- and low-mass star-forming modes. 
- Method:
	- NIKA2 survey of l=24, Taurus, and Ophiuchus at 1.15 and 2 mm.
- Progress:
	- They detected 321 previously-undetected clumps, 80% of them are 70 micro quiet (starless candidates). This new population is less massive and cooler than previously detected clumps. Based on masses at different evolutionary stage, they found evidence for clump mass growth, supporting models of clump-fed high-mass star formation.  
- Note:	
	- Additional molecular line observations at large scales could provide information on the material accretion toward MYSO, in turns supporting the clump-fed scenario.

#### [Revisiting Rotation Measures from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey: the Magnetic Field in the Disk of the outer Galaxy](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210202856V/abstract)
- # CGPS # B-field # Rotation Measure
- Question:
	- B fields are important in terms of dynamics and evolution with energy densities comparable to the turbulence and significantly exceeding the thermal energy. Combined with the models of the free electron density, RMS can be used to construct models of the B field. However, current RM measurements are still limited. 
- Aims:
	- have a high sky density of RMs is very important in maximizing the value and reliability of analysis using RMs, and surveys that produce large numbers of RMs. 
- Method: 
	- Make use the CGPS survey.
- Progress:
	- They have derived rotation measures for 2234 sources (4 of which are known pulsars), 75% of which have no previous measurements, over an area of approximately 1300 square degrees.
