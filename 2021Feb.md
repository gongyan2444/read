#### [Feedback in Forming Star Clusters: The Mass-Radius Relation and Mass Function of Molecular Clumps in the Large Magellanic Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12260)
- # Mass-radius relation
- Question: 
	- The mass-size relation in the external galaxies are not studied. This is now feasible with ALMA toward clumps in LMC.
- Aims: 
	- To study the mass-size relation in LMC.
- method: 
	- They used the dendrogram-based catalog of clumps compiled by Wong et al. from 12CO and 13CO maps of six giant molecular clouds in the LMC observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). 
- progress: 
	- They find that the mass-radius relation and mass function of LMC clumps have power-law forms, R∝Mα and dN/dM∝Mβ, with indices α=0.36±0.03 and β=−1.8±0.1 over the mass ranges 102M⊙≲M≲105M⊙ and 102M⊙≲M≲104M⊙, respectively. The derived β is consistent with the simple feedback model proposed by Fall, Krumholz, and Matzner. They conclude that the situation portrayed here for clumps and clusters in the LMC replicates that in the Milky Way.

#### [Dark Supernova Remnants revealed by CO-line Bubbles in the W43 Molecular Complex along the 4-kpc Arm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00592)
- # W43 # SNR 
- Question:
	- Currently, about 300 SNRs have been detected in the Milky Way, but the number is still far from the completeness. New methods are needed to find the SNRs in the Milky Way.
- Aims: 
	- Find dark SNRs in the Milky Way.
- Method: 
	- Use CO data to find the dark SNRs.
- Progress:
	- They found CO bubbles in W43. The CO bubbles are interpreted as due to fully evolved buried SNRs in molecular clouds after rapid exhaustion of the released energy in dense molecular clouds. The CO bubbles may be a direct evidence for exciting and maintaining the turbulence in GMCs by SN origin. Search for CO bubbles as "dark SNRs" (dSNR) will have implication to estimate the supernova rate more accurately, and hence the star formation activity in the Milky Way.
- Note: 
	- They used a background filter to detect the clumps and filaments in CO data.
