#### [Feedback in Forming Star Clusters: The Mass-Radius Relation and Mass Function of Molecular Clumps in the Large Magellanic Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12260)
- # Mass-radius relation
- Question: 
	- The mass-size relation in the external galaxies are not studied. This is now feasible with ALMA toward clumps in LMC.
- Aims: 
	- To study the mass-size relation in LMC.
- method: 
	- They used the dendrogram-based catalog of clumps compiled by Wong et al. from 12CO and 13CO maps of six giant molecular clouds in the LMC observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). 
- progress: 
	- They find that the mass-radius relation and mass function of LMC clumps have power-law forms, R∝Mα and dN/dM∝Mβ, with indices α=0.36±0.03 and β=−1.8±0.1 over the mass ranges 102M⊙≲M≲105M⊙ and 102M⊙≲M≲104M⊙, respectively. The derived β is consistent with the simple feedback model proposed by Fall, Krumholz, and Matzner. They conclude that the situation portrayed here for clumps and clusters in the LMC replicates that in the Milky Way.

#### [Dark Supernova Remnants revealed by CO-line Bubbles in the W43 Molecular Complex along the 4-kpc Arm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00592)
- # W43 # SNR 
- Question:
	- Currently, about 300 SNRs have been detected in the Milky Way, but the number is still far from the completeness. New methods are needed to find the SNRs in the Milky Way.
- Aims: 
	- Find dark SNRs in the Milky Way.
- Method: 
	- Use CO data to find the dark SNRs.
- Progress:
	- They found CO bubbles in W43. The CO bubbles are interpreted as due to fully evolved buried SNRs in molecular clouds after rapid exhaustion of the released energy in dense molecular clouds. The CO bubbles may be a direct evidence for exciting and maintaining the turbulence in GMCs by SN origin. Search for CO bubbles as "dark SNRs" (dSNR) will have implication to estimate the supernova rate more accurately, and hence the star formation activity in the Milky Way.
- Note: 
	- They used a background filter to detect the clumps and filaments in CO data.

#### [The AMBRE Project: Origin and evolution of sulfur in the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01961)
- # sulfur # Chemical evolution
- Question:
	- Sulfur is a volatile chemical element that plays an important role in tracing the chemical evolution of galaxies. However, its nucleosynthesis origin and abundance variations are still unclear.
- Aims:
	- to accurately and precisely study the S-content of large number of stars located in the solar neighbourhood.
- Method:
	- We use the parametrisation of thousands of HR stellar spectra provided by the AMBRE Project, and combine it with the automated abundance determination GAUGUIN to derive LTE sulfur abundances for 1855 slow-rotating FGK-type stars.
- Progress:
	- The [S/M] abundances ratio is compatible with a plateau-like distribution in the metal-poor regime, and then starts to decrease continuously at [M/H]~-1.0dex. This decrease continues towards negative values for supersolar metallicity stars as recently reported for Mg and as predicted by Galactic chemical evolution models. Moreover, sulfur-rich stars having [M/H] in the range [-1.0,-0.5] have very different kinematical and orbital properties with respect to more metal-rich and sulfur-poor ones. Two disc components, associated with the thin and thick discs, are thus seen independently in kinematics and sulfur abundances. the enrichment in sulfur with respect to iron is nicely correlated with stellar ages: older metal-poor stars have higher [S/M] ratios than younger metal-rich ones. This work has confirmed that sulfur is an alfa-element that could be considered to explore the Galactic populations properties.
- Note:
	- The sulfur isotopic ratio can be estimated with H2S, CS etc.

#### [HII regions and high-mass starless clump candidates II. Fragmentation and induced star formation at ~0.025 pc scale: An ALMA continuum study](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201207738Z/abstract)
- # Fragmentation # Triggered star formation
- Question:
	- The feedback of HII regions may alter the properties in the surrounding gas. The question of whether the presence of HII regions modifies the core-scale fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored.
- Aims:
	- They aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by HII regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted HMSCs. 
- Method:
	-  Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum with a resolution of ~1.3", we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by HII regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. 
- Progress:
	- The feedback seems not to affect the fragmentation, but shape the morphology. They found two-level hierarchical features.. 
- Note:
	- See more details of the ACR method on the “multimode” package in Ameijeiras-Alonso et al. (2018).

#### [The connection between warm carbon chain chemistry and interstellar irradiation of star-forming cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02681)
- # carbon chain # irradiation 
- Question:
	- WCCC is promoted in star-forming cores exposed to radiation from the interstellar medium. Irradiation is only one possible cause or prerequisite for WCCC.. However, this is not confirmed by models. 
- Aims:
	- to qualitatively investigate the chemistry of carbon chains in star-forming cores irradiated from outside by comparing the chemistry of carbon chains in a shielded cloud core and in a core exposed to radiation. In this way, we aim to understand, if outside irradiation can facilitate the formation of a WCCC core.
- Method:
	- the astrochemical model to test the hypothesis.
- Progress:
	- In the full irradiation model, the abundances of carbon chains were found to be higher by a factor of few to few hundred, compared to the model with low irradiation. Higher carbon-chain abundances in the prestellar stage and, presumably, in the extended circumstellar envelope, arise because of irradiation of gas and dust by interstellar photons and cosmic rays. They suggest that WCCC can be caused by exposure of a star-forming core to interstellar radiation, or even just to cosmic rays.
- Note: 
	- PDR seems to account for WCCC!!!

#### [GASTON: Galactic Star Formation with NIKA2. Evidence for the mass growth of star-forming clumps](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.tmp..241R/abstract)
- # NIKA2 # 1.15 mm continuum survey
- Question:
	- The formation of high-mass star formation is still not well known. Two popular mechanisms (core-fed and clump fed) are proposed. In core fed mode, MYSOs accretes material from a compact (<=0.1 pc) fixed mass reservoir. In clump fed mode, MYSOs grow in mass as a result of large scale and hierarchical gravitational collapse of its parent molecular clump (>=1 pc). The transition between high-mass and low-mass star-forming modes are also poorly constrained. 
- Aims: Determine the mechanism of high-mass star formation. Search for signatures of the transition between the high- and low-mass star-forming modes. 
- Method:
	- NIKA2 survey of l=24, Taurus, and Ophiuchus at 1.15 and 2 mm.
- Progress:
	- They detected 321 previously-undetected clumps, 80% of them are 70 micro quiet (starless candidates). This new population is less massive and cooler than previously detected clumps. Based on masses at different evolutionary stage, they found evidence for clump mass growth, supporting models of clump-fed high-mass star formation.  
- Note:	
	- Additional molecular line observations at large scales could provide information on the material accretion toward MYSO, in turns supporting the clump-fed scenario.

#### [Revisiting Rotation Measures from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey: the Magnetic Field in the Disk of the outer Galaxy](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210202856V/abstract)
- # CGPS # B-field # Rotation Measure
- Question:
	- B fields are important in terms of dynamics and evolution with energy densities comparable to the turbulence and significantly exceeding the thermal energy. Combined with the models of the free electron density, RMS can be used to construct models of the B field. However, current RM measurements are still limited. 
- Aims:
	- have a high sky density of RMs is very important in maximizing the value and reliability of analysis using RMs, and surveys that produce large numbers of RMs. 
- Method: 
	- Make use the CGPS survey.
- Progress:
	- They have derived rotation measures for 2234 sources (4 of which are known pulsars), 75% of which have no previous measurements, over an area of approximately 1300 square degrees.

#### [SiO, 29SiO, and 30SiO emission from 67 oxygen-rich stars. A survey of 61 maser lines from 7 to 1 mm](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210203548R/abstract)
- # O-rich stars # SiO masers
- Question:
	- Circumstellar environments of oxygen-rich stars are among the strongest SiO maser emitters. Physical processes such as collisions, infrared pumping and overlaps favors the inversion of level population and produce maser emission at different vibrational states. Despite numerous observational and theoretical efforts, we still do not have an unified picture including all the physical processes involved in the SiO maser emission. 
- Aims:
	- The aim of this work is to provide homogeneous data in a large sample of oxygen-rich stars. 
- Method:
	- We present a survey of 67 oxygen-rich stars from 7 to 1 mm, in their rotational transitions from J=1-0 to J=5-4, for vibrational numbers v from 0 to 6 in the three main SiO isotopologues. We have used one of the 34 m NASA antennas at Robledo and the IRAM 30 m radio telescope. 
- Progress:
	- The J=1-0, v=2 line flux is greater than the corresponding v=1 in almost half of the sample, which may confirm a predicted dependence on the pulsation cycle. This database is potentially useful in models which should consider most of the physical agents, time dependency, and mass-loss rates.
- Note:
	- This can be used a reference for follow-up monitoring results to investigate the relationship with the stellar pulsation.

#### [Star formation in 'the Brick': ALMA reveals an active proto-cluster in the Galactic centre cloud G0.253+0.016](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03560)
- # CMZ # Brick # G0.253+0.016
- Question:
	- Star formation is questioned in the CMZ where star formation rate is much lower despite a large amount of molecular gas. G0.253+0.016, aka 'the Brick', is one of the most massive (> 10^5 Msun) and dense (> 10^4 cm-3) molecular clouds in the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone. Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. 
- Aims:
	- investigate if there are star formation ongoing in G0.253+0.016.
- Method:
	- They present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13" (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core', and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016.
- Progress:
	- We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ~ 2 Msun), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multi-directional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments.

#### [Multi-scale view of star formation in IRAS 21078+5211: From clump fragmentation to disk wind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04872)
- # Fragmentation # HMSF
- Questions:
	- The processes of the formation of these clusters via the collapse and fragmentation of the parental molecular
clump into multiple smaller cores, and mass accretion on individual cores, are not yet clear.
- Aims:
	- We want to investigate the nearby (located at 1.63±0.05 kpc) high-mass star-forming region IRAS 21078+5211 at linear scales from ∼1 pc down to ∼10 au.
- Method:
	- We combine the data of two recent programs: the NOEMA project CORE and the Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS) survey. The former provides images of the 1 mm dust continuum and molecular line emissions with a linear resolution of ≈ 600 au covering a field of view up to ~0.5 pc. The latter targets the ionized gas and 22 GHz water masers, mapping linear scales from a few 103 au down to a few astronomical units.
- Progress:
	- We show that the 3D maser velocities are fully consistent with the magneto-centrifugal disk-wind models predicting a cylindrical rotating jet.


#### [ATLASGAL -- selected massive clumps in the inner Galaxy. IX. Deuteration of ammonia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04478)
- # Deuteration # HMSF
- Questions:
	- Deuteration has been used as a tracer of the evolutionary phases of low- and high-mass star formation. The deuteration of ATLASGAL clumps are not fully studied. 
- Aims:
	- We study the amount of deuteration using NH2D in a representative sample of high-mass clumps discovered by the ATLASGAL survey covering various evolutionary phases of massive star formation.
- Method:
	- NH2D lines at 74/86/110 GHz with MOPRA+IRAM 30m.
- Progress:
	- The high detection rate of NH2D confirms a high deuteration previously found in massive star-forming clumps. Using the excitation temperature of NH2D instead of NH3 is needed to avoid an overestimation of deuteration. We measure a higher detection rate of NH2D in sources at early evolutionary stages. We determine a median ortho-to-para column density ratio of 3.7±1.2.
- Note:
	- These deuterated molecules need to be mapped in the future in order to shed light on the environmental influence on the molecules.

#### [Measuring magnetization with rotation measures and velocity centroids in supersonic MHD turbulence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05647)
- # B-field # turbulence # anisotropic 
- Questions:
	- Turbulent anisotropy provides valuable information on both the direction and strength of the magnetic field. However, its measurement is difficult especially in highly supersonic turbulence in cold interstellar phases due to the distortions by isotropic density fluctuations.
- Aims: 
	- establish the relationship between the anisotropy and magnetic field.
- Method:
	- By using 3D simulations of supersonic and sub-Alfvénic magnetohydrodynamic(MHD) turbulence, we find that the problem can be alleviated when we selectively sample the volume-filling low-density regions in supersonic MHD turbulence.
- Progress:
	- In these low-density regions, the anisotropy of RM and VC fluctuations depends on the Alfvénic Mach number as M<sub>A</sub><sup>−4/3</sup>. This anisotropy-M<sub>A</sub> relation is theoretically expected for sub-Alfv 'enic MHD turbulence and confirmed by our synthetic observations of 12CO emission. It provides a new method for measuring the plane-of-the-sky magnetic fields in cold interstellar phases.

#### [C18O, 13CO, and 12CO abundances and excitation temperatures in the Orion B molecular cloud: An analysis of the precision achievable when modeling spectral line within the Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08317)
- # Orion B # excitation
- Questions:
	- Previous LTE assumption may bias the excitation of 12CO, 13CO, C18O. New method is needed to better constrain the excitation.
- Aims:
	- estimating the abundances, excitation temperatures, velocity field and velocity dispersions of the three main CO isotopologues towards a subset of the Orion B molecular cloud.
- Method:
	- We use the Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) technique to analyze and estimate the precision of the physical parameters in the framework of local-thermodynamic-equilibrium excitation and radiative transfer with an additive white Gaussian noise.
- Progress:
	- the different CO isotopologues have distinct excitation temperatures, and the line intensity ratios between different isotopologues do not accurately reflect the column density ratios. We find mean fractional abundances that are consistent with previous determinations towards other molecular clouds. However, significant local deviations are inferred, not only in regions exposed to UV radiation field but also in shielded regions. These deviations result from the competition between selective photodissociation, chemical fractionation, and depletion on grain surfaces. We observe that the velocity dispersion of the C18O emission is 10% smaller than that of 13CO. The substantial gain resulting from the simultaneous analysis of two different rotational transitions of the same species is rigorously quantified. 
- Note:
	- Basically, we can use a different method (e.g., MCMC) to do the same calculation.

#### [Transition from Coherent Cores to Surrounding Cloud in L1688](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06459.pdf)
- # core # transition from cloud to cores
- Questions:
	- Stars form in cold dense cores showing subsonic velocity dispersions. The parental molecular clouds display higher temperatures and supersonic velocity dispersions. The transition from core to cloud has been observed in velocity dispersion, but temperature and abundance variations are unknown.
- Aims:
	- We aim to measure the temperature and velocity dispersion across cores and ambient cloud in a single tracer to study the transition between the two regions.
- Method:
	- We use NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) maps in L1688 from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey, smoothed to 10
, and determine the physical properties by fitting the spectra. We identify the coherent cores and study the changes in temperature and velocity dispersion from cores to the surrounding cloud.
- Progress:
	- The cloud is 4–6 K warmer than the cores, and shows a larger velocity dispersion (0.15–0.25 km/s). Comparing to Herschel-based dust temperatures, we find that cores show kinetic temperature ~1.8 K lower than the dust temperature; while the gas temperature is higher than the dust temperature in the cloud. We find an average p-NH3 fractional abundance (with respect to H2) of (4.2±0.2) ×1e-9 towards the coherent cores, and (1.4±0.1) ×1e-9 outside the core boundaries. We discover that the subsonic component extends up to 0.15 pc beyond the typical coherent boundaries, unveiling larger extents of the coherent cores and showing gradual transition to coherence over ∼ 0.2 pc.
- Note:
	- Similar studies can be performed with CO data.

#### [Revealing Gravitational Collapse in Serpens G3-G6 Molecular Cloud using Velocity Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06225)
- # Velocity gradients # collapse # Serpens
- Questions:
	- The relative role of turbulence, magnetic fields, self-gravity in star formation is a subject of intensive debate.
- Aims:
	- using VGT, IGT, and PDF to identify the signature of collapsing.
- Method:
	- We present IRAM 30m telescope observations of the 13CO (1-0) emission in the Serpens G3-G6 molecular cloud and apply to the data a set of statistical methods. Those include the probability density functions (PDFs) of column density and the Velocity Gradients Technique (VGT). We combine our data with the Planck 353 GHz polarized dust emission observations, Hershel H2 column density.
- Progress:
	- the Serpens G3-G6 south clump is undergoing a gravitational collapse. Our analysis reveals that the gravitational collapse happens at volume density nHI ≥ 103 cm−3. We estimate the plane-of-the-sky magnetic field strength of approximately 120 µG using the traditional Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method and 100 µG using a new technique proposed in Lazarian et al. (2020). We find the Serpens G3-G6 south clump’s total magnetic field energy significantly surpasses kinetic energy and gravitational energy. We conclude that the gravitational collapse could be successfully triggered in a supersonic and sub-Alfvenic cloud.
- Note:
	- The methods can be used to study the regions without polarization measurements. 

#### [On the stickiness of CO2 and H2O ice particles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06683)
- # Dust grain # grain chemistry # ice
- Questions:
	- Laboratory experiments revealed that CO2 ice particles stick less efficiently than H2O ice particles, and there is an order of magnitude difference in the threshold velocity for sticking. However, the surface energies and elastic moduli of CO2 and H2O ices are comparable, and the reason why CO2 ice particles were poorly sticky compared to H2O ice particles was unclear.
- Aims:
	- study why CO2 ice particles were poorly sticky compared to H2O ice particles.
- Method:
	- Here we investigate the effects of viscoelastic dissipation on the threshold velocity for sticking of ice particles using the viscoelastic contact model derived by Krijt et al.
- Progress:
	- the threshold velocity for sticking of CO2 ice particles reported in experimental studies is comparable to that predicted for perfectly elastic spheres. In contrast, the threshold velocity for sticking of H2O ice particles is an order of magnitude higher than that predicted for perfectly elastic spheres. Therefore, we conclude that the large difference in stickiness between CO2 and H2O ice particles would mainly originate from the difference in the strength of viscoelastic dissipation, which is controlled by the viscoelastic relaxation time.
- Note:
	- H2O and CO2 ices are important components in dust grains.

#### [An HST Survey of Protostellar Outflow Cavities: Does Feedback Clear Envelopes?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06717)
- # outflow # 
- Questions:
	- The evolution of protostellar envelope and outflow is poorly constrained. 
- Aims:
	- We study protostellar envelope and outflow evolution using Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS or WFC3 images of 304 protostars in the Orion Molecular clouds.  
- Methods:
	- These near-IR images resolve structures in the envelopes delineated by the scattered light of the central protostars with 80 AU resolution and they complement the 1.2-870 micron spectral energy distributions obtained with the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey program (HOPS).
- Progress:
	- Based on their 1.60 micron morphologies, we classify the protostars into five categories: non-detections, point sources without nebulosity, bipolar cavity sources, unipolar cavity sources, and irregulars. Class 0 protostars more likely to be non-detections, Class I protostars to show cavities and flat-spectrum protostars to be point sources. We find no evidence for the growth of outflow cavities as protostars evolve through the Class I protostar phase, in contradiction with previous studies of smaller samples. We conclude that the decline of mass infall with time cannot be explained by the progressive clearing of envelopes by growing outflow cavities. Furthermore, the low star formation efficiency inferred for molecular cores cannot be explained by envelope clearing alone.
- Note:
	- The observations give quite a lot of different results from previous measurements. 

#### [Simultaneous Deep Measurements of CO isotopologues and Dust Emission in Giant Molecular Clouds in the Andromeda Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07129)
- # CO # Andromeda
- Questions:
	- A census of GMC in external galaxies is rare. Such study beyond the Milky Way is needed.
- Aims:
	- Characterize the GMCs in the Andromeda Galaxy.
- Methods:
	- We present simultaneous measurements of emission from dust continuum at 230 GHz and the J=2-1 12CO, 13CO and C18O isotopologues at ∼ 15 pc resolution from individual Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). These observations were obtained in an ongoing survey of this galaxy being conducted with the Submillimeter Array (SMA).
- Progress:
	- We derive 13CO and C18O abundances of 2.9e−6 and 4.4e−7 relative to H2 by assuming a Milky Way gas-to-dust ratio. The isotopic abundance ratio [13CO ]/[C18O ] = 6.7±2.9 to be consistent with the Milky Way value (8.1). we derive the mass-to-light conversion factors for all three CO species to be α12 = 8.7 ± 3.9, α13 = 48.9 ± 20.4 and α18 = 345 Msun (K km s<sup>−1</sup>pc<sup>2</sup>)<sup>−1</sup> for the J=2-1 transitions of 12CO , 13CO and C18O , respectively.
- Note:
	- CO survey toward Andromeda.


#### [On the Beam Filling Factors of Molecular Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06917)
- # filling factor # MWISP
- Questions:
	- filling factors are quite unclear in quite a number of observations.
- Aims:
	-  investigate the dependence of observations on angular resolution (beam sizes), sensitivity (noise levels), distances, and molecular tracers. 
- Methods:
	- MWISP + simulated observations.
- Progress:
	- the beam filling factor can be described by a characteristic size, l1/4=0.762 (in beam size), at which the beam filling factor is approximately 1/4. The sensitivity clip factor shows a similar relationship but is more correlated with the mean voxel signal-to-noise ratio of molecular clouds. This result may serve as a practical reference on beam filling and sensitivity clip factors in further analyses of the MWISP data and other observations.
- Note:
	- Not quite clear about the clip factors. Need to read it in more details.


#### [Sagittarius B1 -- A Patchwork of H II Regions and PhotoDissociation Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07031)
- # Sgr B1 # CMZ
- Questions:
	- Sgr B1 is a luminous H II region in the Galactic Center immediately next to the massive star-forming giant molecular cloud Sgr B2 and apparently connected to it from their similar radial velocities. there is no central exciting star cluster and that the ionizing stars must be widely spread throughout the region. The PDR structures are puzzled.
- Aims:
	-  determining the PDR's structure and relation to the associated H II regions
- Methods:
	- we present SOFIA FIFI-LS observations of the [O I] 146 and [C II] 158 micron lines formed in the surrounding photodissociation regions (PDRs).
- Progress:
	- the [O I] 146 and [C II] 158 micron lines correlate neither with each other nor with the [O III] lines although together they correlate better with the 70 micron Herschel PACS images. We infer from this that Sgr B1 consists of a number of smaller H II regions plus their associated PDRs, some seen face-on and the others seen more or less edge-on. We likewise conclude that the hot stars exciting Sgr B1 are widely spaced throughout the region at substantial distances from the gas with no evidence of current massive star formation.

#### [Revealing a Centrally Condensed Structure in OMC-3/MMS 3 with ALMA High Resolution Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07793)
- # OMC 
- Questions:
	- It appears that MMS 3 is in the prestellar phase before gravitational contraction has begun. Although we could not detect a central condensation in MMS 3 in the SMA observation, a protostar has already been born within MMS 3.
	This is a way to study the properties of the first hydrostatic core.
- Aims:
	- study the structure of MM3.
- method:
	- ALMA observations.
- Progress:
	- The centrally condensed object associated with the near-infrared and X-ray sources, the flattened envelope, and the faint outflow indicate that MMS 3 harbors a low mass protostar with an age of ∼10<sup>3</sup> yr.
- Note:
	- It is unknown if it is the first hydrostatic core.


#### [Protoplanetary disk formation from collapse of prestellar core](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07963)
- # ppd # prestellar core
- Questions:
	- While it is generally accepted that the magnetic field and its non-ideal effects play important roles during the stellar formation, simple models of pure hydrodynamics and angular momentum conservation are still widely employed in the studies of disk assemblage in the framework of the so-called "alpha-disk" model due to their simplicity. There has only been a few efforts trying to bridge the gap between a collapsing prestellar core and a developed disk. 
- Aims:
	- revisit the assemblage of the protoplanetary disk (PPD), by performing 3D MHD simulations with ambipolar diffusion and full radiative transfer. 
- Method:
	- We follow the global evolution of the PPD from the prestellar core collapse for 100 kyr, with resolution of one AU.
- Progress:
	- The surface mass flux is very centrally peaked, implying that most of the mass falling onto the star does not transit through the mid-plane of the disk. The disk mid-plane is almost dead to turbulence, whereas upper layers and the disk outer edge are very turbulent. The snow-line is significantly further away than in a passive disk. We developed a zoomed rerun technique to quickly obtain a reasonable disk that is highly stratified, weakly magnetized inside, and strongly magnetized outside. During the class-0 phase of PPD formation, the interaction between the disk and the infalling envelope is important and ought not be neglected. Accretion onto the star is found to mostly depend on dynamics of the collapsing envelope, rather than the detailed disk structure.

#### [Constraining the population of isolated massive stars within the Central Molecular Zone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08126)
- # CMZ 
- Questions:
	- Many galaxies host pronounced circumnuclear starbursts, fuelled by infalling gas. Such activity is expected to drive the secular evolution of the nucleus and generate super winds, while the intense radiation fields and extreme gas and cosmic ray densities present may act to modify the outcome of star formation with respect to more quiescent galactic regions.
- AIMS:
	- Previous studies reveal that it hosts a rich population of very massive stars; these are located within three clusters, with an additional cohort dispersed throughout the Central Molecular Zone. In this paper we investigate the size and composition of the latter contingent.
- METHOD: 
	- We employed VLT+KMOS to obtain homogeneous, high S/N spectroscopy of the later cohort for classification and quantitative analysis. 
- Progress:
	- They found 83 isolated massive stars in the CMZ.

#### [The Galactic HII Region Luminosity Function at Radio and Infrared Wavelengths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09033)
- # HII regions # HII luminosity function
- Questions:
	- The Galactic HII region luminosity function (LF) is an important metric for understanding global star formation properties of the Milky Way, but only a few studies have been done and all use relatively small numbers of HII regions.
- Aims:
	- Determine the Galactic HII region luminosity function (LF).
- Method:
	- We use a sample of 797 first Galactic quadrant HII regions compiled from the WISE Catalog of Galactic HII Regions to examine the form of the LF at multiple infrared and radio wavelengths. Our sample is statistically complete for all regions powered by single stars of type O9.5V and earlier.
- Progress:
	- Averaging the results from all wavelengths, the mean of the best-fit single power law index is ⟨α⟩=−1.75±0.01. 
	The consistency of the power law indices across multiple wavelengths suggests that the LF is independent of wavelength.

#### [The warm-up phase in massive star-forming cores around RCW 120](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09145)
- # RCW 120 # hot cores
- Questions:
	- One of the most massive and well-known dense gas condensations at the border of the H ii region RCW 120
has been considered as a high-mass analogue of a Class 0 object for about ten years. However, the physical conditions of the cores in the border have not be well constrained. 
- Aims:
	- constrain the physical/chemical properties of cores in the border of RCW 120.
- Method:
	- We present spectra of molecular emission in the 1 mm range made with the APEX telescope.
- Progress:
	- The detection of the CH3CN lines corresponding to highly excited transitions (Eu>400~K) in Core 2 indicates that the region contains hot gas, while the abundances of CH3OH, CS, SO2 and CH3CN are quite low for a hot core stage. Core 2 is in the beginning of the hot core stage.

#### [Interstellar Detection of 2-Cyanocyclopentadiene, C5H5CN, a Second Five-Membered Ring Toward TMC-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09595)
- # Chemistry # TMC1
- Questions:
	- Using radio observations with the Green Bank Telescope, evidence has now been found for a second five-membered ring in the dense cloud Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1).
- Aims:
	- Find more five-Membered ring in the ISM.
- Method:
	- Based on additional observations of an ongoing, large-scale, high-sensitivity spectral line survey (GOTHAM) at centimeter wavelengths toward this source, we have used a combination of spectral stacking, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and matched filtering techniques to detect 2-cyanocyclopentadiene, a low-lying isomer of 1-cyanocyclopentadiene, which was recently discovered there by the same methods. 
- Progress:
	- The new observational data also yields a considerably improved detection significance for the more stable isomer and evidence for several individual transitions between 23 - 32 GHz. Through our MCMC analysis, we derive total column densities of 8.3×1011 and 1.9×1011 cm−2 for 1- and 2-cyanocyclopentadiene respectively, corresponding to a ratio of 4.4(6) favoring the former. The derived abundance ratios point towards a common formation pathway - most likely being cyanation of cyclopentadiene by analogy to benzonitrile.
- Note:
	- such molecules can be more common than ever thought.

#### [CO+ as a probe of the origin of CO in diffuse interstellar clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09861)
- # diffuse gas # CO+
- Questions:
	- The CO formation path in diffuse clouds. whether the thermal cosmic-ray and UV-driven chemistry is producing CO in diffuse interstellar molecular gas through the intermediate formation of CO+.
- Aims:
	- test CO formation path.
- Method:
	- We searched for CO+ absorption with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) toward two quasars with known Galactic foreground absorption from diffuse interstellar gas, J1717-3342 and J1744-3116, targeting the two strongest hyperfine components of the J=2-1 transition near 236 GHz.
- Progress:
	- We could not detect CO+ but obtained sensitive upper limits toward both targets. The non-detection of CO+ confirms that HCO+ is mainly produced in the reaction between oxygen and carbon hydrides, CH2+ or CH3+ , induced by suprathermal processes, while CO+ and HOC+ result from reactions of C+ with OH and H2O. The densities required to form CO molecules at low extinction are consistent with this scheme.

#### [Molecular gas distribution perpendicular to the Galactic plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10727)
- # Milky Way # Galactic scale
- Questions:
	- Vertical distribution of molecular gas in the Milky Way is poorly known.
- Aims:
	- constrain vertical distribution.
- Method:
	- Using the MWISP molecular clouds to determine the vertical distribution.
- Progress:
	- The molecular disk consists of two components with the layer thickness (FWHM) of ~85pc and ~280pc. Assuming that these clouds are supported by their turbulent motions against the gravitational pull of the disk, a model of rho0(R) = 1.28exp(-R/3.2kpc) Msun/pc^3 can be used to describe the distribution of the total mass density in the Galactic midplane.

#### [The physical and chemical structure of high-mass star-forming regions. Unraveling chemical complexity with the NOEMA large program "CORE"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11676)
- # high-mass star formation
- Questions:
	- Quantified the physical and chemical properties at different high-mass evolutionary stages with high angular resolutions. 
- Aims:
	- Characterizing the physical and chemical properties of forming massive stars at the spatial resolution of individual high-mass cores lies at the heart of current star formation research.
- Method:
	- NOEMA CORE survey.
- Progress:
	-  We find an average temperature power-law index of q = 0.4±0.1 and an average density power-law index of p = 2.0±0.2 on scales on the order of several 1 000 au. The hot molecular cores show the most emission lines, but we also find evolved cores at an evolutionary stage, in which most molecules are destroyed and thus the spectra appear line-poor again.
- Note:
	- Data are available from https://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/core/Overview.html

#### [What Produces Dust Polarization in the HH 212 Protostellar Disk at 878 μm: Dust Self-Scattering or Dichroic Extinction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11481)
- # B-field
- Questions:
	- poloidal fields around disks are still poorly constrained.
- Aims:
	- study the poloidal field around disks.
- Method:
	- ALMA dust polarization measurements. 
- Progress;
	- The polarization orientations are mainly parallel to the minor axis of the disk, with some in the western part tilting slightly away from the minor axis to form a concave shape with respect to the center. This can be due to dust self-scattering (by 50-75 um grains in a young disk) or dichroic extinction, or both.
