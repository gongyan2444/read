#### [Feedback in Forming Star Clusters: The Mass-Radius Relation and Mass Function of Molecular Clumps in the Large Magellanic Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12260)
- # Mass-radius relation
- Question: 
	- The mass-size relation in the external galaxies are not studied. This is now feasible with ALMA toward clumps in LMC.
- Aims: 
	- To study the mass-size relation in LMC.
- method: 
	- They used the dendrogram-based catalog of clumps compiled by Wong et al. from 12CO and 13CO maps of six giant molecular clouds in the LMC observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). 
- progress: 
	- They find that the mass-radius relation and mass function of LMC clumps have power-law forms, R∝Mα and dN/dM∝Mβ, with indices α=0.36±0.03 and β=−1.8±0.1 over the mass ranges 102M⊙≲M≲105M⊙ and 102M⊙≲M≲104M⊙, respectively. The derived β is consistent with the simple feedback model proposed by Fall, Krumholz, and Matzner. They conclude that the situation portrayed here for clumps and clusters in the LMC replicates that in the Milky Way.

#### [Dark Supernova Remnants revealed by CO-line Bubbles in the W43 Molecular Complex along the 4-kpc Arm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00592)
- # W43 # SNR 
- Question:
	- Currently, about 300 SNRs have been detected in the Milky Way, but the number is still far from the completeness. New methods are needed to find the SNRs in the Milky Way.
- Aims: 
	- Find dark SNRs in the Milky Way.
- Method: 
	- Use CO data to find the dark SNRs.
- Progress:
	- They found CO bubbles in W43. The CO bubbles are interpreted as due to fully evolved buried SNRs in molecular clouds after rapid exhaustion of the released energy in dense molecular clouds. The CO bubbles may be a direct evidence for exciting and maintaining the turbulence in GMCs by SN origin. Search for CO bubbles as "dark SNRs" (dSNR) will have implication to estimate the supernova rate more accurately, and hence the star formation activity in the Milky Way.
- Note: 
	- They used a background filter to detect the clumps and filaments in CO data.

#### [The AMBRE Project: Origin and evolution of sulfur in the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01961)
- # sulfur # Chemical evolution
- Question:
	- Sulfur is a volatile chemical element that plays an important role in tracing the chemical evolution of galaxies. However, its nucleosynthesis origin and abundance variations are still unclear.
- Aims:
	- to accurately and precisely study the S-content of large number of stars located in the solar neighbourhood.
- Method:
	- We use the parametrisation of thousands of HR stellar spectra provided by the AMBRE Project, and combine it with the automated abundance determination GAUGUIN to derive LTE sulfur abundances for 1855 slow-rotating FGK-type stars.
- Progress:
	- The [S/M] abundances ratio is compatible with a plateau-like distribution in the metal-poor regime, and then starts to decrease continuously at [M/H]~-1.0dex. This decrease continues towards negative values for supersolar metallicity stars as recently reported for Mg and as predicted by Galactic chemical evolution models. Moreover, sulfur-rich stars having [M/H] in the range [-1.0,-0.5] have very different kinematical and orbital properties with respect to more metal-rich and sulfur-poor ones. Two disc components, associated with the thin and thick discs, are thus seen independently in kinematics and sulfur abundances. the enrichment in sulfur with respect to iron is nicely correlated with stellar ages: older metal-poor stars have higher [S/M] ratios than younger metal-rich ones. This work has confirmed that sulfur is an alfa-element that could be considered to explore the Galactic populations properties.
- Note:
	- The sulfur isotopic ratio can be estimated with H2S, CS etc.

#### [HII regions and high-mass starless clump candidates II. Fragmentation and induced star formation at ~0.025 pc scale: An ALMA continuum study](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201207738Z/abstract)
- # Fragmentation # Triggered star formation
- Question:
	- The feedback of HII regions may alter the properties in the surrounding gas. The question of whether the presence of HII regions modifies the core-scale fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored.
- Aims:
	- They aim to investigate the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted by HII regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star formation in the impacted HMSCs. 
- Method:
	-  Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum with a resolution of ~1.3", we imaged eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by HII regions and another four situated in the quiet environment. 
- Progress:
	- The feedback seems not to affect the fragmentation, but shape the morphology. They found two-level hierarchical features.. 
- Note:
	- See more details of the ACR method on the “multimode” package in Ameijeiras-Alonso et al. (2018).

#### [The connection between warm carbon chain chemistry and interstellar irradiation of star-forming cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02681)
- # carbon chain # irradiation 
- Question:
	- WCCC is promoted in star-forming cores exposed to radiation from the interstellar medium. Irradiation is only one possible cause or prerequisite for WCCC.. However, this is not confirmed by models. 
- Aims:
	- to qualitatively investigate the chemistry of carbon chains in star-forming cores irradiated from outside by comparing the chemistry of carbon chains in a shielded cloud core and in a core exposed to radiation. In this way, we aim to understand, if outside irradiation can facilitate the formation of a WCCC core.
- Method:
	- the astrochemical model to test the hypothesis.
- Progress:
	- In the full irradiation model, the abundances of carbon chains were found to be higher by a factor of few to few hundred, compared to the model with low irradiation. Higher carbon-chain abundances in the prestellar stage and, presumably, in the extended circumstellar envelope, arise because of irradiation of gas and dust by interstellar photons and cosmic rays. They suggest that WCCC can be caused by exposure of a star-forming core to interstellar radiation, or even just to cosmic rays.
- Note: 
	- PDR seems to account for WCCC!!!

#### [GASTON: Galactic Star Formation with NIKA2. Evidence for the mass growth of star-forming clumps](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.tmp..241R/abstract)
- # NIKA2 # 1.15 mm continuum survey
- Question:
	- The formation of high-mass star formation is still not well known. Two popular mechanisms (core-fed and clump fed) are proposed. In core fed mode, MYSOs accretes material from a compact (<=0.1 pc) fixed mass reservoir. In clump fed mode, MYSOs grow in mass as a result of large scale and hierarchical gravitational collapse of its parent molecular clump (>=1 pc). The transition between high-mass and low-mass star-forming modes are also poorly constrained. 
- Aims: Determine the mechanism of high-mass star formation. Search for signatures of the transition between the high- and low-mass star-forming modes. 
- Method:
	- NIKA2 survey of l=24, Taurus, and Ophiuchus at 1.15 and 2 mm.
- Progress:
	- They detected 321 previously-undetected clumps, 80% of them are 70 micro quiet (starless candidates). This new population is less massive and cooler than previously detected clumps. Based on masses at different evolutionary stage, they found evidence for clump mass growth, supporting models of clump-fed high-mass star formation.  
- Note:	
	- Additional molecular line observations at large scales could provide information on the material accretion toward MYSO, in turns supporting the clump-fed scenario.

#### [Revisiting Rotation Measures from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey: the Magnetic Field in the Disk of the outer Galaxy](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210202856V/abstract)
- # CGPS # B-field # Rotation Measure
- Question:
	- B fields are important in terms of dynamics and evolution with energy densities comparable to the turbulence and significantly exceeding the thermal energy. Combined with the models of the free electron density, RMS can be used to construct models of the B field. However, current RM measurements are still limited. 
- Aims:
	- have a high sky density of RMs is very important in maximizing the value and reliability of analysis using RMs, and surveys that produce large numbers of RMs. 
- Method: 
	- Make use the CGPS survey.
- Progress:
	- They have derived rotation measures for 2234 sources (4 of which are known pulsars), 75% of which have no previous measurements, over an area of approximately 1300 square degrees.

#### [SiO, 29SiO, and 30SiO emission from 67 oxygen-rich stars. A survey of 61 maser lines from 7 to 1 mm](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210203548R/abstract)
- # O-rich stars # SiO masers
- Question:
	- Circumstellar environments of oxygen-rich stars are among the strongest SiO maser emitters. Physical processes such as collisions, infrared pumping and overlaps favors the inversion of level population and produce maser emission at different vibrational states. Despite numerous observational and theoretical efforts, we still do not have an unified picture including all the physical processes involved in the SiO maser emission. 
- Aims:
	- The aim of this work is to provide homogeneous data in a large sample of oxygen-rich stars. 
- Method:
	- We present a survey of 67 oxygen-rich stars from 7 to 1 mm, in their rotational transitions from J=1-0 to J=5-4, for vibrational numbers v from 0 to 6 in the three main SiO isotopologues. We have used one of the 34 m NASA antennas at Robledo and the IRAM 30 m radio telescope. 
- Progress:
	- The J=1-0, v=2 line flux is greater than the corresponding v=1 in almost half of the sample, which may confirm a predicted dependence on the pulsation cycle. This database is potentially useful in models which should consider most of the physical agents, time dependency, and mass-loss rates.
- Note:
	- This can be used a reference for follow-up monitoring results to investigate the relationship with the stellar pulsation.

#### [Star formation in 'the Brick': ALMA reveals an active proto-cluster in the Galactic centre cloud G0.253+0.016](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03560)
- # CMZ # Brick # G0.253+0.016
- Question:
	- Star formation is questioned in the CMZ where star formation rate is much lower despite a large amount of molecular gas. G0.253+0.016, aka 'the Brick', is one of the most massive (> 10^5 Msun) and dense (> 10^4 cm-3) molecular clouds in the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone. Previous observations have detected tentative signs of active star formation, most notably a water maser that is associated with a dust continuum source. 
- Aims:
	- investigate if there are star formation ongoing in G0.253+0.016.
- Method:
	- They present ALMA Band 6 observations with an angular resolution of 0.13" (1000 AU) towards this 'maser core', and report unambiguous evidence of active star formation within G0.253+0.016.
- Progress:
	- We detect a population of eighteen continuum sources (median mass ~ 2 Msun), nine of which are driving bi-polar molecular outflows as seen via SiO (5-4) emission. At the location of the water maser, we find evidence for a protostellar binary/multiple with multi-directional outflow emission. Despite the high density of G0.253+0.016, we find no evidence for high-mass protostars in our ALMA field. The observed sources are instead consistent with a cluster of low-to-intermediate-mass protostars. However, the measured outflow properties are consistent with those expected for intermediate-to-high-mass star formation. We conclude that the sources are young and rapidly accreting, and may potentially form intermediate and high-mass stars in the future. The masses and projected spatial distribution of the cores are generally consistent with thermal fragmentation, suggesting that the large-scale turbulence and strong magnetic field in the cloud do not dominate on these scales, and that star formation on the scale of individual protostars is similar to that in Galactic disc environments.

#### [Multi-scale view of star formation in IRAS 21078+5211: From clump fragmentation to disk wind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04872)
- # Fragmentation # HMSF
- Questions:
	- The processes of the formation of these clusters via the collapse and fragmentation of the parental molecular
clump into multiple smaller cores, and mass accretion on individual cores, are not yet clear.
- Aims:
	- We want to investigate the nearby (located at 1.63±0.05 kpc) high-mass star-forming region IRAS 21078+5211 at linear scales from ∼1 pc down to ∼10 au.
- Method:
	- We combine the data of two recent programs: the NOEMA project CORE and the Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS) survey. The former provides images of the 1 mm dust continuum and molecular line emissions with a linear resolution of ≈ 600 au covering a field of view up to ~0.5 pc. The latter targets the ionized gas and 22 GHz water masers, mapping linear scales from a few 103 au down to a few astronomical units.
- Progress:
	- We show that the 3D maser velocities are fully consistent with the magneto-centrifugal disk-wind models predicting a cylindrical rotating jet.


#### [ATLASGAL -- selected massive clumps in the inner Galaxy. IX. Deuteration of ammonia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04478)
- # Deuteration # HMSF
- Questions:
	- Deuteration has been used as a tracer of the evolutionary phases of low- and high-mass star formation. The deuteration of ATLASGAL clumps are not fully studied. 
- Aims:
	- We study the amount of deuteration using NH2D in a representative sample of high-mass clumps discovered by the ATLASGAL survey covering various evolutionary phases of massive star formation.
- Method:
	- NH2D lines at 74/86/110 GHz with MOPRA+IRAM 30m.
- Progress:
	- The high detection rate of NH2D confirms a high deuteration previously found in massive star-forming clumps. Using the excitation temperature of NH2D instead of NH3 is needed to avoid an overestimation of deuteration. We measure a higher detection rate of NH2D in sources at early evolutionary stages. We determine a median ortho-to-para column density ratio of 3.7±1.2.
- Note:
	- These deuterated molecules need to be mapped in the future in order to shed light on the environmental influence on the molecules.
