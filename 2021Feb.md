#### [Feedback in Forming Star Clusters: The Mass-Radius Relation and Mass Function of Molecular Clumps in the Large Magellanic Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.12260)
- # Mass-radius relation
- Question: 
	- The mass-size relation in the external galaxies are not studied. This is now feasible with ALMA toward clumps in LMC.
- Aims: 
	- To study the mass-size relation in LMC.
- method: 
	- They used the dendrogram-based catalog of clumps compiled by Wong et al. from 12CO and 13CO maps of six giant molecular clouds in the LMC observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). 
- progress: 
	- They find that the mass-radius relation and mass function of LMC clumps have power-law forms, R∝Mα and dN/dM∝Mβ, with indices α=0.36±0.03 and β=−1.8±0.1 over the mass ranges 102M⊙≲M≲105M⊙ and 102M⊙≲M≲104M⊙, respectively. The derived β is consistent with the simple feedback model proposed by Fall, Krumholz, and Matzner. They conclude that the situation portrayed here for clumps and clusters in the LMC replicates that in the Milky Way.
