## Studies on various gas tracers

#### [On the density regime probed by HCN emission ](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211205543J/abstract)
- Question:
        - Gao+Solomon (2004) found a close linear relationship between star formation and HCN luminosity, based on the assumption that HCN (1-0) traces densities of >1e4 cm−3. However, recent studies indicate that the assumption is not valid.	
- Aims:
        - Investigate the density regime probed by HCN. 
- new method:
        - They analyzed data from post-processing of high resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations.
- progress:
        - They confirmed that HCN emission traces gas with a mean volumetric density of about 3e3 cm−3 and a median visual extinction of 5 mag. This provides additional evidence that HCN can trace more diffuse gas. 

#### [Multi-line observations of CH3OH, c-C3H2 and HNCO towards L1544: Dissecting the core structure with chemical differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09806)
- Question:
	- L1544 is a prototypical pre-stellar core, which provides a testbed to compare the observations and models of the density/abundance profiles.
- Aims:
	- HNCO, c-C3H2, and CH3OH molecules are selected for this study.
- Method:
	- non-LTE model of multiple transitions to derive the physical properties. 
- Progress:
	- HNCO->c-C3H2->CH3OH. They find that a local gas density enhancement on the BE sphere is required, which means that the density profile should be revised accordingly. Such an enhancement might be due to the accretion-driven shocks.
- Comments:
	- To model prestellar cores, the smooth density profiles might not be suitable to reproduce all the observed phenomenen like CH3OH in L1544. This will becomes even better if the enhancement can be regarded as a signature of accretion-driven shocks.


#### [Cyanopolyyne chemistry in the L1544 prestellar core: new insights from GBT observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10106)
- Question:
  - Large carbon chains might have a crucial role in the heritage of organic material from the pre- and protostellar phase to the objects of the newly formed planetary system, such as asteroids and comets. However, the carbon chains are only extensively studied in TMC1. TMC1 is a starless core, but the prestellar core is not well studied. 
- Aim:
  - L1544 is a prestellar core, so it is suitable to study its carbon-chain chemsitry in order to shed light on the whole class.
- Method:
  - GBT line survey observations covering 8.0-11.6 GHz, and 13.5-14.4 GHz. This survey also aims to obtain the first census of molecular lines in this radio spectral range towards a well known and established analogue of the Solar System precursor.
- progress:
  - They resolve double-peak spectral line profiles with the redshifted peak a factor 3-5 brighter. The bulk of the cyanopolyyne emission is likely associated with the southern region of the core, where free carbon atoms are available to form long chains.
- Comments:
  - They said HC5N:HC7N:HC9N=1:6:4, which is misleading. Actually, HC5N:HC7N=6, HC7N/HC9N=4. The result is quite interesting. They attribute the abundant carbon chain molecules to the free carbon carbon caused by either young ages or UV illumination. This would explain the so-called WCCC as well.


#### [183 GHz water megamasers in active galactic nuclei: a new accretion disk tracer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02572)
- Question:
  - water megamasers are useful tools to study AGN disks. Only three AGNs (NGC 3079, Circinus, NGC 4945) are known to host H2O megamasers other than 22 GHz. 
- Method:
  -  an ALMA survey to identify 183 GHz H2O maser emission from AGN
already known to host 22 GHz megamaser systems.
- progress:
  - They detected significant 183 GHz maser emission from 13 galaxies. They tracing the circumnuclear accretion disk at larger orbital radii than are occupied by the 22 GHz masers.
- Comments:
  - luminosity depends on frequency. higher frequency leads to higher luminosity. For a certain luminosity, the flux density would be lower at higher frequency. This presents a motivation to detect submm masers.  They trace different locations.


#### [ALMA Detection of 321 GHz water maser emission in the radio galaxy NGC 1052](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04211)
- Question:
  - The plasma torus obscures the core by free–free absorption (FFA) casting a gap between two maser clusters (Sawada-Satoh+2008). Submillimeter (sub-mm) observations are crucial to probe inside the obscuring torus.
- Aim:
  - detect submm masers to investigate the environments inside the obscuring torus.
- Method:
  - ALMA (321) GBT (22)
- progress:
  - They detected a broad and a narrow component in the 321 GHz maser toward NGC 1052. 
- comments:
  - It is not clearly why the 321GHz water masers are shifted with respect to the 22 GHz water masers. This at least suggests that the 321 GHz masers are tracing different parts of the galaxy.



#### [Reconstructing the shock history in the CMZ of NGC 253 with ALCHEMI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12685)
- Question:
  - The simultaneous detection of SiO and HNCO in regions where the star formation rate is high may be used to study the shock history of the gas.
- Aims:
  - They aim to constrain the shock history of NGC253 with ALCHEMI and to characterize the gas properties, and to investigate the chemical origin of the emission.
- method:
  - ALCHEMI line survey.
- progress:
  - They confirm that fast and slow shocks are responsible for SiO and HNCO production, respectively. They suggest that most of the GMCs are subjected to shocks.
- Note:
  - In their discusssion, They mentioned a few interesting shock scenario and ponteital history for NGC253.


#### [Collisional excitation of PO+ by para-H2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08052)
- progress:
  - They deliever rate coefficients for the rotational (de-)excitation of PO+ induced by collisions with H2. This will facinate the non-LTE calculations using PO+. They predict that PO+ can be masering at a density of 1e4 to 1e6 cm-3. However, PO+ is seldom detected in the ISM so far.
