## B field

#### [Magnetic fields and outflows in the large Bok globule CB 54](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06055)
- Question: 
	- Recent observations have shown that in some cases, dust polarisation around young protostars appears to trace their outflow cavity walls, suggesting compression and rearrangement of magnetic fields by outflow feedback. However, the
physical scales over which and timescales on which this rearrangement can occur are not well-established, and neither is the range of magnetic environments in which this rearrangement of the field can take place.
- Aims: 
	- investigate if outflows can reshape the B field morphology. CB 54 is quite isolated, so it is helpful for assessment.
- new method: 
	- JCMT POL-2 measurements.
- progress: 
	- even a relatively weak outflow may be able to significantly reshape magnetic fields in star-forming regions on scales >0.1 pc.
- comments:
	- This same situation may occur in Ophiuchus North 1.


#### [The C4H Zeeman Effect in TMC-1: Understanding Low-Mass Star Formation](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJS..162..388T/abstract)
- progress:
	- They provide a novel tracer to study Zeeman effects of C4H, but they did not manage to detect the Zeeman effects. This is quite suitable to constrain the magnetic field of magnetized clumps undergoing ambipolar diffusion (AD). They discussed three different models from the Mouschovias, Shu, and Myers groups.


#### [First clear detection of the CCS Zeeman splitting toward the pre-stellar core, Taurus Molecular Cloud 1](https://academic.oup.com/pasj/article/71/6/117/5610015)
- progress:
	- They confirm the CCS Zeeman effects as the possible tool to obtain the magnetic field strength. THey obtained a value of 117 microGauss for TMC1. They used the Nobeyama-45m telescope for this study.

#### [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12604](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12604)
- progress:
	- They used the 22.3GHz CCS line to measure TMC1 with VLA. The value of 2mG is much higher than the value of Nobeyam-45m. They found a subcritical envelope enclosing a supercritical core.
