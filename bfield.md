## B field

#### [Magnetic fields and outflows in the large Bok globule CB 54](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06055)
- Question: 
	- Recent observations have shown that in some cases, dust polarisation around young protostars appears to trace their outflow cavity walls, suggesting compression and rearrangement of magnetic fields by outflow feedback. However, the
physical scales over which and timescales on which this rearrangement can occur are not well-established, and neither is the range of magnetic environments in which this rearrangement of the field can take place.
- Aims: 
	- investigate if outflows can reshape the B field morphology. CB 54 is quite isolated, so it is helpful for assessment.
- new method: 
	- JCMT POL-2 measurements.
- progress: 
	- even a relatively weak outflow may be able to significantly reshape magnetic fields in star-forming regions on scales >0.1 pc.
- comments:
	- This same situation may occur in Ophiuchus North 1.


#### [The C4H Zeeman Effect in TMC-1: Understanding Low-Mass Star Formation](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJS..162..388T/abstract)
- progress:
	- They provide a novel tracer to study Zeeman effects of C4H, but they did not manage to detect the Zeeman effects. This is quite suitable to constrain the magnetic field of magnetized clumps undergoing ambipolar diffusion (AD). They discussed three different models from the Mouschovias, Shu, and Myers groups.


#### [First clear detection of the CCS Zeeman splitting toward the pre-stellar core, Taurus Molecular Cloud 1](https://academic.oup.com/pasj/article/71/6/117/5610015)
- progress:
	- They confirm the CCS Zeeman effects as the possible tool to obtain the magnetic field strength. THey obtained a value of 117 microGauss for TMC1. They used the Nobeyama-45m telescope for this study.

#### [Magnetic field measurement in TMC-1C using 22.3 GHz CCS Zeeman splitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12604)
- progress:
	- They used the 22.3GHz CCS line to measure TMC1 with VLA. The value of 2mG is much higher than the value of Nobeyam-45m. They found a subcritical envelope enclosing a supercritical core.


#### [Multi-scale physical properties of NGC 6334 as revealed by local relative orientations between magnetic fields, density gradients, velocity gradients, and gravity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00152)
- Question:
  - Understanding the interactions between magnetic fields, gravity, and turbulence have been a key topic in the study of star formation. 
- Aims:
  - using different measurements to assess the relative importance of B, gravity, and turbulence. 
- Method:
  - A synergistic analysis with these techniques using relative orientations between different angles will be advantageous in revealing the physical conditions in star-forming molecular clouds.
- progress:
  -  The relative orientation between B and column density changes from statistically more perpendicular to parallel as column density increases, which is a signature of trans-to-sub-Alfvenic turbulence at complex/cloud scales. The more parallel alignment between B and column density at higher NH2 is because the magnetic field line is dragged by gravity. At even higher NH2, the angle between B and column density gradient, velocity gradient transits back to having no preferred orientation or statistically slightly more perpendicular, suggesting that the magnetic field structure is impacted by star formation activities.  statistically more perpendicular alignment found between θB and θVG throughout our studied NH2 range, which indicates a trans-to-sub-Alfvenic state at small scales as well. The KTH method may fail at high NH2 due to the impact of star formation feedback.
- comments:
  - Their statistical methods are quite interesting and easy to follow.


#### [The Kinematics of the Magnetised Protostellar core IRAS15398-3359](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00987)
- Question:
  - Magnetic fields are considered an important factor during the early stages of star formation, especially during the main accretion phase.However, it is not clear how the B field regulates star formation in core scale 
- Aims:
  - We aim to study the relation between kinematics and magnetic fields at a very early stage of the star formation process.
- Method:
  - APEX molecular line observations + dust polarization measurements.
- progress:
  - The velocity gradient along the central object can be explained as an ongoing outflow motion. The large-scale magnetic field line
observed previously is preferentially aligned to the rotation axis of the core.


#### [The JCMT BISTRO-2 Survey: Magnetic Fields of the Massive DR21 Filament](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac9dfb/pdf)
- Question:
  - The role of B fields in massive star formation is still unexplored. 
- Aims:
  - The role of magnetic fields in the formation of filaments and high-mass star-forming cores.
- Method:
  - JCMT POL-2 observations, structure function/angular dispersion function.
- progress:
  - Ordered magnetic fields perpendicular to the parsec-scale ridge of the DR21
main filament. The plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths derived from angular
dispersion functions of dust polarization are 0.6–1.0 mG in the DR21 filament and ∼0.1 mG in the surrounding ambient gas. The mass-to-flux ratios are found to be magnetically supercritical in the filament and slightly subcritical to nearly critical in the ambient gas. The magnetic field structures of the DR21 filament are in agreement with MHD simulations of a strongly magnetized medium, suggesting that magnetic fields play an important role in shaping the DR21 main filament and subfilaments.


#### [The JCMT BISTRO Survey: Studying the Complex Magnetic Field of L43](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11306)
- Question:
  - It is important to understand the strength and structure of the magnetic fields in these early stages of star formation since their
role may differ from roles played once stars have already formed, for example due to interaction with stellar feedback. Protostellar outflows have
been known to either affect, or be affected by, magnetic fields as seen by many instances of the magnetic fields tracing outflows.
- Aims:
  - We also investigate the interaction of the magnetic field with the CO outflow of RNO 91, an embedded Class I protostar. 
- Method:
  - JCMT POL-2 observations. BISTRO. DCF, ACF. 
- progress:
  - A magnetic field that appears to be aligned with the cavity walls of the outflow, suggesting interaction with the outflow. 160+-30 micro Gauss in the main starless core and up to 90+-40 micro Gauss in the more diffuse, extended region. magnetically super- and sub-critical values respectively and both are found to be roughly trans-Alfvenic.
