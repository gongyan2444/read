## Central Molecular Zone in the Milky Way

#### [ALMA Observations of Massive Clouds in the Central Molecular Zone: Ubiquitous Protostellar Outflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07925)
- Question: 
	- CMZ is a region with a large amount of dense gas but with low star formation rates. The star-forming activities in the CMZ are still not well constrained in this special region. Further investigation of star formation in the CMZ is needed.   
- Aims: 
	- Molecular outflows can trace obscured star formation. This study aims to identify outflows from YSOs in the CMZ. 
- new method: 
	- ALMA 1.3 mm observations of shock tracers, SiO, SO, CH3OH, H2CO, HC3N, and HNCO, down to 2000 au resolution.
- progress: 
	- They identified 43 protostellar outflows (37 highly likely + 6 candidates) while 791 out of the 834 total cores do not have detected outflows. A large amount of starless cores in CMZ, indicate a early evolutionary phase?  Outflow chemistry is similar in the CMZ and nearby clouds.
- note:
	- The conclusion of early phase of star formation seems to contradict the galaxy evolution? or different generations of star formation?
	- They developed a code ([calcu](https://github.com/ShanghuoLi/calcu)) to calculate the outflow parameters.  
	- They also presented the partition functions of H2CO, CH3OH, and HNCO in their Table 2.


#### [The Dense Gas Fraction in Galactic Center Clouds](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...868....7M/abstract)
- Question:
	- The distribution of gas densities in the CMZ and the density structure are poorly constrained.
- Aims:
	- HC3N is a good density probe and its transitions are usually optically thin. This study will use HC3N lines to determine the density structure in the CMZ.
- Method:
	- They use MOPRA 22m, GBT, and APEX to observe a few HC3N lines.
- Progress:
	- Two density component with one lower than 1e4 cm<sup>-3</sup> and the other one between 1e5 and 1e6 cm<sup>-3</sup>. The results support the higher star-formation threshold in the CMZ. The line ratio increases sharply at R<140 pc, indicating the increase of the dense gas fraction.
- note:
	- Actually, one should try to obtain the density distribution of the CMZ.
