## Central Molecular Zone in the Milky Way

#### [ALMA Observations of Massive Clouds in the Central Molecular Zone: Ubiquitous Protostellar Outflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07925)
- Question: 
	- CMZ is a region with a large amount of dense gas but with low star formation rates. The star-forming activities in the CMZ are still not well constrained in this special region. Further investigation of star formation in the CMZ is needed.   
- Aims: 
	- Molecular outflows can trace obscured star formation. This study aims to identify outflows from YSOs in the CMZ. 
- new method: 
	- ALMA 1.3 mm observations of shock tracers, SiO, SO, CH3OH, H2CO, HC3N, and HNCO, down to 2000 au resolution.
- progress: 
	- They identified 43 protostellar outflows (37 highly likely + 6 candidates) while 791 out of the 834 total cores do not have detected outflows. A large amount of starless cores in CMZ, indicate a early evolutionary phase?  Outflow chemistry is similar in the CMZ and nearby clouds.
- note:
	- The conclusion of early phase of star formation seems to contradict the galaxy evolution? or different generations of star formation?
