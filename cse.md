#### [Discovery of the C7N- anion in TMC-1 and IRC+10216](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12819)
- Question:
        - There is controversy about the formation of CnNâˆ’ anions through radiative electron attachment to CnN radicals because calculated rate coefficients differ by orders of magnitude depending on the study. Hence, the detection of nitrile anions and the determination of their abundances in different astronomical environments are an important step forward in understanding the chemistry of anions in space.
- Aims: 
        - detect more anions 
- method:
        - Q-band Ultrasensitive Inspection Journey to the Obscure TMC-1 Environment
- progress:
        - They detected C7N- anion in TMC1 and IRC+10216. So far, C4H-, C6H-, C10H-, C3N-, C5N-, C7N- have already been detected in TMC1/IRC+10216.
