## CO dark gas

#### [Catching the Birth of a Dark Molecular Cloud for the First Time](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...867...13Z/abstract)
- Question: 
	- The transition from H to H2 is a key step to understand the cloud formation and eventually the cosmic structure. However, quantify H2 formation is quite challenging.
- Aims: 
	- To quantify HI/H2 abundance ratio.
- Method:
	- Arecibo observation of HI, FCRAO observations of 13CO, and Herschel dust observations.
- progress: 
	- They discover a prominent "ring" of HI self-absorption. They determine the HI/HI2 abundance ratio to be 2% to 0.2%, which is orders of magnitude higher than usually assumed value. They suggest a cloud formation timescale of 6e6 years, favoring the fast star formation models.


#### [Pilot HI survey of Planck Galactic Cold Clumps with FAST](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020RAA....20...77T/abstract)
- Question:
	- Planck Could clumps have been studied with dense tracers but never studied with low density tracer. HINSA is suitable to characterize the [HI]/[H] ratio and is possible to study the cloud age. 
- Aims:
	- Study HI (low density gas) in PGCCs.
- Method:
	- FAST HINSA observations of 17 Planck Galactic Cold clumps. 
- Progress: 
	- 58% of 17 clumps have HINSA detection. [HI]/[H] is determined to be 4.4e-3. Non-thermal line width is lower than that of 13CO. The cloud age is found to be 10<sup>6.7</sup>-10<sup>7.0</sup> yr for 5 sources.
- Note:
	- The calibration, Doppler tracking and frequency switching are not available in Jan 2019.


#### [Searching for converging flows of atomic gas onto a molecular cloud](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221105801H/abstract)
- Questions:
  - Cloud formation is an unsettle problems. Theories have predicted that cloud formation might be triggered by convergent flows, but this have never been verified.
- Method:
  - They used CII, CO, and HI to investigate the potential transition from HI to H2.
- Progress:
  - They found a redshifted component in CII which is not seen in CO. They intepret it as a signature of a converging flow.
- comments:
  - It is intriguing to see that they constrain the physical conditions with PDRTools, and the density regime appears to be suitable for cloud formation. The onse side flow can be common because the perfect symmetry is not alway fulfilled in the real cases. Searching for the converging flows would be quite interesting. Such flows are expected in SNR, expanding HII regions, or even the large-scale spiral density waves.
