## CO dark gas

- Question: 
	- The transition from H to H2 is a key step to understand the cloud formation and eventually the cosmic structure. However, quantify H2 formation is quite challenging.
- Aims: 
	- To quantify HI/H2 abundance ratio.
- Method:
	- Arecibo observation of HI, FCRAO observations of 13CO, and Herschel dust observations.
- progress: 
	- They discover a prominent "ring" of HI self-absorption. They determine the HI/HI2 abundance ratio to be 2% to 0.2%, which is orders of magnitude higher than usually assumed value. They suggest a cloud formation timescale of 6e6 years, favoring the fast star formation models.
