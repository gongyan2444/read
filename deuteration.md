## Deuteration

#### [A Survey of Deuterated Ammonia in the Cepheus Star-Forming Region L1251](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10718)
- Question: 
	- Understanding the chemical processes during starless core and prestellar core evolution is an important step in understanding the initial stages of star and disk formation. Deteratium fraction is thought to be a good tracer of evolutionary stages. There are a lack of surveys that focus on the chemistry of the entire dense core population within a single cloud.  
- Method:
	- ARO 12m o-NH2D at 85.9 GHz. 
- Aims: 
	- To quantify HI/H2 abundance ratio.
- results:
	- The peak intensity is as high as 0.4 K (Tmb). Abundances are calculated with the herschel  H2 column density. They estimate B from equations. the chemical dichotomy in prestellar cores? 
-Comments:
	- They used a non-unity filling fraction for analysis. Deuterated fraction of the whole cloud is even more fancy. 


#### [The core population and kinematics of a massive clump at early stages: an ALMA view](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01675)
-Question:
	- The core-accretion and clump-fed model predict the different prestellar cores. This work is to distingush them. In early stage, C and O have been frozen out. H2D+ as a better tracer for early cores than other tracers like N2D+. 
- Method:
	- ALMA o-H2D+ observations of AGAL014.492-00.139.
- results:
	- They support the clump-fed model. The cores in prestellar stage are essentially low-mass, and they appear subvirial and gravitationally bound.
- Comments:
	- very fancy 3D interactive webpages.


#### [First detection of CHD2OH towards pre-stellar cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09543)
-Question:
	- Compared to the D/H ratio which depends on the gas-phase enhancement of the main isotopolgue and is prone to the line-of-sight integration of different gas components, the D2/D ratio provides a more
stringent constraint on the deuteration fractionation in situ and is thus critical for advancing the chemical models. The doubly deuterated form of CH3OH has been detectd toward class 0 protostars, but has never been detected toward prestellar cores.  It is still unclear how much of the chemical complexity observed towards protostars is inherited from the prestellar phase. Deuterium fractionation of CH3OH is likely
the best tool to provide quantitative constraints to this question.
- Method:
	- very sensitive IRAM 30m observations. 1-4 mK @0.18 km/s.
- Results:
	-They derive a D/H ratio of 0.8-1.9% with CH2DOH in pre-stellar cores H-MM1 and L694-2, which is well consistent with the values in later stages and comets. This inidcates that such deuterated fraction might be directly inherited from the prestellar cores. High CHD2OH/CH2DOH ratio of 50%--80% suggest that CHD2OH is formed via the addition of H to D2CO on dust grains.
- Comments:
	- The D/H ratios between starless cores and prestellar cores are different, which might be due to increasing densities.
