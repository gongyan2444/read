## Studies on the tracers for ionized gas 

#### [Discovery of a New Population of Galactic H II Regions with Ionized Gas Velocity Gradients](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921..176B/abstract)
- Question:
        - kinematic motions within H II regions have not been systematically investigated in a large sample with a rather high angular resolution. 
- Aims:
        -  Invistigating the kinematic properties of Galactic H II regions using radio recombination line (RRL) emission
- new method:
        - ATCA and VLA observations. Pixel-by-pixel Gaussian fit to the data cubes.
- progress:
        - They discover velocity gradients in 178 (42%) of the nebulae. About 15% of the sources also have an RRL width spatial distribution that peaks toward the center of the nebula. They explained that the velocity gradients inherited angular momentum from their parent molecular clouds.
- comments:
	- It is also argued that the bipolar outflow can create the velocity gradients. It would need more specific models to distinguish the outflow and rotation models.
