## Studies on various gas tracers

#### [On the density regime probed by HCN emission ](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211205543J/abstract)
- Question:
        - Gao+Solomon (2004) found a close linear relationship between star formation and HCN luminosity, based on the assumption that HCN (1-0) traces densities of >1e4 cm−3. However, recent studies indicate that the assumption is not valid.	
- Aims:
        - Investigate the density regime probed by HCN. 
- new method:
        - They analyzed data from post-processing of high resolution magnetohydrodynamical simulations.
- progress:
        - They confirmed that HCN emission traces gas with a mean volumetric density of about 3e3 cm−3 and a median visual extinction of 5 mag. This provides additional evidence that HCN can trace more diffuse gas. 

#### [Multi-line observations of CH3OH, c-C3H2 and HNCO towards L1544: Dissecting the core structure with chemical differentiation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09806)
- Question:
	- L1544 is a prototypical pre-stellar core, which provides a testbed to compare the observations and models of the density/abundance profiles.
- Aims:
	- HNCO, c-C3H2, and CH3OH molecules are selected for this study.
- Method:
	- non-LTE model of multiple transitions to derive the physical properties. 
- Progress:
	- HNCO->c-C3H2->CH3OH. They find that a local gas density enhancement on the BE sphere is required, which means that the density profile should be revised accordingly. Such an enhancement might be due to the accretion-driven shocks.
- Comments:
	- To model prestellar cores, the smooth density profiles might not be suitable to reproduce all the observed phenomenen like CH3OH in L1544. This will becomes even better if the enhancement can be regarded as a signature of accretion-driven shocks.
