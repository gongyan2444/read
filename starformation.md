## Star Formation

#### [The Star Formation Rate of the Milky Way as seen by Herschel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05573)
- Question: 
	- A new method to derive SFRs. Other methods are listed in Table 1.
- Aims: 
	- study star formation rates in the Milky Way..
- Method:
	- using Herschel data.
- progress: 
	- The overall SFR is 2 Msun/yr similar to previous studies. SFR density peaks toward the CMZ and Rg~5kpc, and followed an exponential decrease. The fraction of SFR is 84% and 15% within and outside the Solar circle. The far outer Galaxy (Rg>13.5 kpc) is only 1%.
