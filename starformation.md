## Star Formation

#### [The Star Formation Rate of the Milky Way as seen by Herschel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05573)
- Question: 
	- A new method to derive SFRs. Other methods are listed in Table 1.
- Aims: 
	- study star formation rates in the Milky Way..
- Method:
	- using Herschel data.
- progress: 
	- The overall SFR is 2 Msun/yr similar to previous studies. SFR density peaks toward the CMZ and Rg~5kpc, and followed an exponential decrease. The fraction of SFR is 84% and 15% within and outside the Solar circle. The far outer Galaxy (Rg>13.5 kpc) is only 1%. 


#### [Differences in chemical evolution between isolated and embedded prestellar cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12529)
- progress:
	- For prestellar cores, chemical also depends on the ambient environment around cores.


#### [A Complete HCN Survey of the Perseus Molecular Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07623)
- Question:
  - CO is not a good tracer for dense gas. CS, HCN, NH3, N2H+ are better ones. Dust is a good tracer of dense gas, but is not feasible for distant clouds and external galaxies.
- Aim:
  -  Calibrate a molecular tracer with dust can increase the effectiveness of molecular line tracers. 1) accurately measure the total HCN luminosity from an entire, spatially resolved, GMC in order to make a robust determination of α(HCN) for molecular clouds, and 2) to determine the range of molecular hydrogen column and volume densities which produce detectable HCN emission. 
- Method:
  - HCN might be a good tracer of dense gas. Knowledge of the dense gas contents of molecular clouds is crucial for understanding star formation and galaxy evolution. No more than one square degree of sky has been systematically surveyed in HCN emission in any nearby cloud.
- Progress:
  - They show that the HCN intensity remains linear with H2 column density well into the regime where the CO line saturates. They found a direct measurement of the ratio of dense gas mass to HCN luminosity for an entire nearby molecular cloud: α(HCN) = 92 M /(K km s−1 pc2).
- comments:
  - The conversion factor can be directly applied to galaxies. what about other tracers? Some studies have debated that HCN (1-0) do not really trace dense gas, which even triggers the discussion between the electrons and HCN by Goldsmith and Kauffmann.


#### [GMC Collisions As Triggers of Star Formation. VIII. The Core Mass Function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10657)
- Question:
  - Since core mass function might be directly linked to the initial mass function. It would be good to see how cloud-cloud collisions affect the core mass function.
- Aim:
  - Investigate the impact of cloud-cloud collisions on the core mass function.
- Method:
  - Simualations:
- Progress:
  - Cloud-cloud collisions can produce a top-heavy core mass function, while non-collision clouds produce Salpeter-like slope. In the collision sample, cores tend to be warmer, more turbulent, and easily gravitational unbound. However, the protocluster of cores tend to be subvirial.

#### [The parallax and 3D kinematics of water masers in the massive star-forming region G034.43+0.24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09129)
- Progress:
  - G034.43+0.24 is actually located at ~3kpc rather than 1.5pc proposed earlier.


#### [Can we observe the ion-neutral drift velocity in prestellar cores?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09583)
- Question:
  - Ambipolar diffusion is thought to play an important role in star formation in terms of accumulating mass toward dense cores. However, such phenonoment is not easily verified in observations.
- Aim:
  - The ion-neutral drift velocity is taken to be the smoking gun of the ambipolar diffusion. One has to justify the feasility of the tracers. One needs assess which factor (chemistry, radiative transfer and/or observational difficulties) is the most challenging to overcome in our efforts to detect the ion-neutral drift velocity.
- Method:
  - MHD+radiative transfer codes.
- Progress:
  - Temperature has a significant effect in the amplitude of the drift velocity with the coldest modelled cores (T = 6 K) exhibiting drift velocities comparable to the sound speed. They suggest that HCN and HCNH+ are chemically co-evolving and could be good tracers to measure the ion-neutral drift velocity.
- Comments:
  - HCNH+ is easily accessible now. Such observations should be straightforward.
