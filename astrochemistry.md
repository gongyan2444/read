#### [CHEMOUT: CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy. I. Organic molecules and tracers of star-formation activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00719)
- Question:
        - Because of lower metallicity in the outer galaxy, the chemistry is expected to be different from inner galaxy. However, this has never been throughfully tested.	
- Aims:
        - metallicity dependence of chemistry
- new method:
        - IRAM 30m survey of star formation regions at 3 mm. 
- progress:
        - They detect simple organic species HCO+, H13CO+, HCN, c-C3H2, HCO, C4H, and HCS+, of the complex hydrocarbon CH3CCH, and of SiO, CCS and SO. It discusses an interesting question about the Galactic Habitable Zone which should have enough heavy elements to form rocky planets and low concentration of high energy. 
- comment:
	- The distance itself is not very accurate, which needs more efforts from parallax measurements. This survey suffers significant beam dilution if they are really far away from the GC. For such studies, higher angular resolution observations should be more feasible to produce fruitful results. 


#### [The Detection of Deuterated Water in the Large Magellanic Cloud with ALMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04325)
- Questions:
	- Chemistry in low metallicity environments. 
- Aim:
	- TO investigate if chemistry is affected by low metallicity.
- results:
	- HDO 211-212 has been detected toward hot cores N105-2A and 2B in the N105 star-forming region. This is the first detection in an extragalactic hot core.


#### [CHEMOUT: CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy III. Nitrogen isotopic ratios in the outer Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10620)
- Questions:
	- The carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios in the outer Galaxy are quite uncertain.
- results:
	- the 14N/15N ratios from HCN and HNC for 14 and 3 sources. An overall linear decreasing H13CN/HC15N ratio with increasing R_GC. This translates to a parabolic 14N/15N ratio with a peak at 11 kpc.
- Comments:
	- The data are quite noisy. More constraints.


#### [Efficient Methanol Production on the Dark Side of a Prestellar Core](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab8f93/pdf)
- Questions:
  - CH3OH is believed to form via hydrogenation of frozen carbon monoxide on dust grains. It is released back to gas phase via heating or nonthermal desorption.There are possible for the nonthermal desorption, i.e., photodesorption and photodissociation by external radiation fields, cosmic-rays, reactive desorption, grain-grain collision iduced by gas velcoity fluctuations.
- method:
  - They used ALMA to study starless core Ophiuchus H-MM1 with o-NH2D, CH3OH, and SO.
- results:
  - they found CH3OH/SO form a hole surrounding the core. This is caused by desorption from grains. These two molecules are only abundant in a narrow zone in the eastern side of the core, which could be caused by the external radiation field from the west. However, the stark contrast observed in H-MM1 cannot be explained without assuming enhanced desorption on the shaded side. The brightest emsion has a wavy strcture which is a signature of KHI. They thus conclude that CH3OH/SO are released as a result of grain-grain collisions induced by shear veorticity.
- Note:
  - It is very interesting mechanism in additional to the photodesorption. This indicates that turbulence (turbulent dissipation regions Godard.B+2009) can make an important contribution of chemistry as well. 


#### [The Detection of Hot Molecular Cores in the Small Magellanic Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05630)
- Questions:
  - Obtaining a comprehensive view of chemical compositions of hot cores at various metallicities should help understand the effect of the metallicity on the chemical evolution of protostellar sources.
- Aim:
  - study the chemistry in low-metallicity (1/4-1/10 Z_sun) environments.
- Method:
  - ALMA observations of S07, S09
- progress:
  - They reported the first detection of hot cores in SMC. The diversity in the initial condition of star formation (e.g., degree of shielding, local radiation field strength) may lead to the large abundance variation of organic molecules in hot cores. High-excitation SO2 lines will be a useful hot-core tracer in the low-metallicity environments

#### [Detection of ethanol, acetone, and propanal in TMC-1: New O-bearing complex organics in cold sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16121)
- Questions:
	- ethanol (C2H5OH), acetone (CH3COCH3), and propanal (C2H5CHO) are not detected in starless cores. 
- Aim:
	- The addition of these three new pieces to the puzzle of complex organic molecules in cold interstellar clouds stresses the rich chemical diversity of cold dense cores in stages prior to the onset of star formation.
- method:
	- Yesbes QUIJOTE survey.
- progress:
	- column densities of (1.1 +/- 0.3)e12 cm-2 for C2H5OH, (1.4 +/- 0.6)e11 cm-2 for CH3COCH3, and (1.9 +/- 0.7)e11 cm-2 for C2H5CHO. They propose that Ethanol is formed on grains by addition of atomic carbon on methanol followed by hydrogenation and non-thermal desorption. Acetone and propanal are produced by the gas-phase reaction between atomic oxygen and two different isomers of the C3H7 radical, where the latter follows from the hydrogenation of C3 on grains followed by non-thermal desorption.



#### [The spatial distribution of an aromatic molecule, C6H5CN, in the cold dark cloud TMC-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15315)
- Questions:
  - The modelling of molecular emission is often tackled with very limited information on the spatial extent of the observed lines. 
sion.
- Aims:
  - Distribution of benzonitrile.
- Method:
  - Yebes. Surveying the Area of the Neighbour TMC-1 Cloud through Heterodyne Observations (SANCHO). A new project.
- progress:
  - Benzonitrile follows that of cyanopolyynes rather well, but differs significantly from that of the radicals CnH and CnN. This supports a bottom-up chemistry that aromatic species in TMC-1 are formed from chemical reactions involving smaller species in the densest zones of the cloud.


#### [A 3D physico-chemical model of a pre-stellar core. I. Environmental and structural impact on the distribution of CH$_3$OH and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05932)
-Questions:
	- Previous observations unveil the chemicial fractionation in prestellar and starless cores. This could be caused by the effects of the core structure and external environment on the chemical structure of pre-stellar cores.
- Method:
	- They use the 3D MHD model of a pre-stellar core embedded in a dynamic star-forming cloud to reproduce the observed properties in L1544.
- progress:
	- Extended methanol emission is shifted towards colder and more shielded regions of the core envelope while câ€“C3H2 emission overlaps with the dust continuum. That is not due to the increased ISRF or CRIR. This study confirms Spezzano's early result that the observed chemical dichotomy in L1544 can arise as a result of uneven illumination due to the asymmetrical structure of the 3D core and the environment within which the core has formed.
- Comments:
	- The two tracers are carefully selected. CH3OH in prestellar cores mainy depend on the CO ice (then non-thermal desorption), while c-C3H2 is mainly formed in gas-phase.


#### [Formation of complex organic molecules on interstellar CO ices? Insights from computational chemistry simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16116)
- Question:
  - Carbon ($^3$P) atom is a reactive species that, according to laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations, condensates with interstellar ice components. This fact is of uttermost importance for the chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM) because the condensation reaction is barrierless and the subsequent species formed are still reactive given their open-shell character. Carbon condensation on CO-rich ices forms the CCCO species, which can be easily hydrogenated twice to form ketene (H2CCO). Ketene is very reactive in terrestrial conditions, usually found as an intermediate hard to be isolated in chemical synthesis laboratories. These characteristics suggest that ketene can be a good candidate to form interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) via a two-step process, i.e., its activation followed by a radical-radical coupling.
- Aims:
  - They want to study the reactions between H2CCO and H/OH/NH2 to see which reaction is preferred. 
- Method:
  - quantum chemical calculations complemented by kinetic calculations	
- Progress:
  -  H addition to ketene (helped by tunneling) to form the acetyl radical (CH3CO) is the most preferred path, as the reactions with OH and NH2 possess activation energie hard to surmount in the ISM conditions. CH3CHO and CH3CH2OH can be form via further hydrogenation.  
- Comments:
  - One might be able to detect H2CCO and CH3CH2OH toward prestellar and starless cores.
