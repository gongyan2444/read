#### [Ice-Coated Pebble Drift as a Possible Explanation for Peculiar Cometary CO/H2O Ratios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12751)
- # commets # CO/H2O ratio
- Question: 
	- To date, at least three comets -- 2I/Borisov, C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS), and C/2009 P1 (Garradd) -- have been observed to have unusually high CO concentrations compared to water. 
- Aims and method: 
	- We attempt to explain these observations by modeling the effect of drifting solid (ice and dust) material on the ice compositions in protoplanetary disks.  
- progress: 
	- A population of CO ice enhanced planetesimals are likely to generally form in the outer regions of disks, and we speculate that the aforementioned CO-rich comets may be more common, both in our own Solar System and in extrasolar systems, than previously expected.

#### [The Southern HII Region Discovery Survey. II. The Full Catalog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12199)
- # HII regions # radio continuum
- Question:
	- A complete census of Galactic HII regions will place constraints on models of Milky Way formation and evolution, but a lack of sensitive surveys in the southern sky has left this census incomplete.
- aim:
	- identify HII regions in the southern sky.
- method:
	- ATCA 4-10 GHz radio continuum and RRL survey. The search for new HII regions is now complete over the range 259 deg < Galactic longitude < 346 deg, |Galactic latitude| < 4 deg for HII region candidates with predicted 6 GHz continuum peak brightnesses >30 mJy/beam.
- progress:
	- We detect radio continuum emission toward 730 targets altogether including previously known nebulae and HII region candidates. By averaging ~18 RRL transitions, we detect RRL emission toward 206 previously known HII regions and 436 HII region candidates. Including the northern sky surveys, over the last decade the HII Region Discovery Surveys have more than doubled the number of known Galactic HII regions. The census of HII regions in the WISE Catalog of Galactic HII Regions is now complete for nebulae with 9 GHz continuum flux densities > 250 mJy. We compare the RRL properties of the newly discovered SHRDS nebulae with those of all previously known HII regions. The median RRL full-width at half-maximum line width of the entire WISE Catalog HII region population is 23.9 km/s and is consistent between Galactic quadrants. The observed Galactic longitude-velocity asymmetry in the population of HII regions probably reflects underlying spiral structure in the Milky Way.

#### [Modeling chemistry during star formation: Water deuteration in dynamic star-forming regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12135)
- # water # HDO/H2O
- Question: 
	- Recent observations of the HDO/H2O ratio toward protostars in isolated and clustered environments show an apparent dichotomy, where isolated sources show higher D/H ratios than clustered counterparts.
- Aims: 
	- Establishing which physical and chemical processes create this differentiation can provide insights into the chemical evolution of water during star formation and the chemical diversity during the star formation process and in young planetary systems
- method: 
	- The evolution of water is modeled using 3D physicochemical models of a dynamic star-forming environment. The physical evolution during the protostellar collapse is described by tracer particles from a 3D MHD simulation of a molecular cloud region. Each particle trajectory is post-processed using RADMC-3D to calculate the temperature and radiation field. The chemical evolution is simulated using a three-phase grain-surface chemistry model and the results are compared with interferometric observations of H2O, HDO, and D2O in hot corinos toward low-mass protostars. 
- progress: 
	- The observed dichotomy in water D/H ratios requires variation in the initial conditions (e.g., the duration and temperature of the prestellar phase). Reproducing the observed D/H ratios in hot corinos requires a prestellar phase duration t∼1-3 Myr and temperatures in the range T∼ 10-20 K prior to collapse. This work demonstrates that the observed differentiation between clustered and isolated protostars stems from differences in the molecular cloud or prestellar core conditions and does not arise during the protostellar collapse itself.

#### [The TMRT K Band Observations towards 26 Infrared Dark Clouds: NH3, CCS, and HC3N](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12985)
- # IRDC # chemistry
- Question: 
	- IRDC marks the initial conditions of massive star formation. CCS was not detected by previous observations, questioning the chemistry of CCS at the IRDC stage. 
- Aims: 
	- study the chemistry of IRDC.
- method: 
	- TMRT observations of NH3, CCS, and HC3N.
- progress: 
	- The column density ratios of CCS to NH3 for most of the IRDCs are less than 10−2, distinguishing IRDCs from low-mass star-forming regions. This is thought to be due to the chemical evalutionary consequence.

#### [Observations of 12.2 GHz methanol masers towards northern high-mass protostellar objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13953)
- # 12.2 GHz methanol masers
- Question:
	- Class II methanol masers at 6.7 and 12.2 GHz occur close to high-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs). When they are observed simultaneously, such studies may contribute to refining the characterisation of local physical conditions
- Aims:
	- We aim to search for the 12.2 GHz methanol emission in 6.7 GHz methanol masers that might have gone undetected in previous surveys of northern sky HMYSOs, mainly due to their variability. Contemporaneous observations of both transitions are used to refine the flux density ratio and examine the physical parameters.
- Method:
	- We observed a sample of 153 sites of 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission in the 12.2 GHz methanol line with the Torun 32 m radio telescope, using the newly built X-band receiver.
- Progress:
	- The 12.2 GHz methanol maser emission was detected in 36 HMYSOs, with 4 of them detected for the first time. The 6.7 GHz to 12.2 GHz flux density ratio for spectral features of the contemporaneously observed sources has a median value of 5.1, which is in agreement with earlier reports. The ratio differs significantly among the sources and for the periodic source G107.298+5.639 specifically, the ratio is weakly recurrent from cycle to cycle, but it generally reaches a minimum around the flare peak. This is consistent with the stochastic maser process, where small variations in the physical parameters along the maser path can significantly affect the ratio. A comparison of our data with historical results (from about ten years ago) implies significant (> 50%) variability for about 47% and 14% at 12.2 GHz and 6.7 GHz, respectively.
- Note:
	- The 12.2 GHz methanol masers seem to be less variable.
