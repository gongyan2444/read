## CO dark gas

#### [Catching the Birth of a Dark Molecular Cloud for the First Time](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...867...13Z/abstract)
- Question: 
	- The transition from H to H2 is a key step to understand the cloud formation and eventually the cosmic structure. However, quantify H2 formation is quite challenging.
- Aims: 
	- To quantify HI/H2 abundance ratio.
- Method:
	- Arecibo observation of HI, FCRAO observations of 13CO, and Herschel dust observations.
- progress: 
	- They discover a prominent "ring" of HI self-absorption. They determine the HI/HI2 abundance ratio to be 2% to 0.2%, which is orders of magnitude higher than usually assumed value. They suggest a cloud formation timescale of 6e6 years, favoring the fast star formation models.


#### [Pilot HI survey of Planck Galactic Cold Clumps with FAST](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020RAA....20...77T/abstract)
- Question:
	- Planck Could clumps have been studied with dense tracers but never studied with low density tracer. HINSA is suitable to characterize the [HI]/[H] ratio and is possible to study the cloud age. 
- Aims:
	- Study HI (low density gas) in PGCCs.
- Method:
	- FAST HINSA observations of 17 Planck Galactic Cold clumps. 
- Progress: 
	- 58% of 17 clumps have HINSA detection. [HI]/[H] is determined to be 4.4e-3. Non-thermal line width is lower than that of 13CO. The cloud age is found to be 10<sup>6.7</sup>-10<sup>7.0</sup> yr for 5 sources.
- Note:
	- The calibration, Doppler tracking and frequency switching are not available in Jan 2019.
